This is a rough estimation...

134
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,312
but let's just say that the human
eye has 12 working parts, right?

135

136
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,574
So, if we can fill in the gaps,
the evolutionary gaps...

137
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,904
using single mutations...

138
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,282

of the most basic eye...

140
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,836

146
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,726
Right.

147
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,475
Each of these animals has an eye

148
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,193

for its environment.

149
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,898

150
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,576

151
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,363
Go on.

152
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,414
You start with one...

153
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,334
to get to 12. But what if you had zero?

154
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:04,207
A non-seeing organism and built
genetically an eye from scratch...

155
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,126
a zero to 12.

156
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,129

have the PAX6 gene.
