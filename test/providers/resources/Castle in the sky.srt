1
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:43,801
Ha ha ha!

2
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,990
- Ha ha ha!

3
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,104
Mayday! Mayday!

4
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,885
- Pirates!

5
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,290
- Hold them off!

6
00:02:17,365 --> 00:02:19,799
Sheeta, stay out of the way
and you won't get hurt.

7
00:02:44,726 --> 00:02:46,159
Aah!

8
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,694
- Come on!

9
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,203
Hurry up!
Break the door down!

10
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,940
SHEETA: Aah!

11
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:09,540
Yaah! Oof!

12
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,954
- Where is she?

13
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,217
No!

14
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,384
Hey, I found her!
She's hiding out here!

15
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,554
Don't let her escape!
Quick, get her!

16
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,860
LOUIE: Whoa, Ma!
Don't let me go!

17
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:25,365
DOLA: Quit your whining!
I got you!

18
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,866
Aah!
She's wearing the crystal!

19
00:03:26,935 --> 00:03:28,960
- Now, go get her!
- Right!

20
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:31,870
I want that crystal!

21
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:39,376
Aaah!

22
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:42,883
DOLA: Oh, no!
There goes my crystal!

23
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,181
Oh, no!

24
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,347
I need some meatballs
for the boss, please.

25
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,545
All right. You're sure
working late tonight, Pazu.

26
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,986
Things are finally busy
for a change.

27
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,752
- Still working?
- Yep. Bye!

28
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,621
Huh?

29
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:43,528
What is that?

30
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,737
Looks like a body! Whoa!

31
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,944
Whoa!

32
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,713
Aah! Whoa! Whoa!

33
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,028
Yaah!

34
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,698
Huh?

35
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,540
Aah!

36
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,663
BOSS: Pazu!

37
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,634
What are you doing up there?

38
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,295
Did you bring my dinner?

39
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,668
Yeah, I did!

40
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,764
But this girl
came down from the sky!

41
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,076
Ohh...

42
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,548
BOSS:
Blast these old pipes!

43
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,175
Aah! Whoa.

44
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,913
Uh, here you go.

45
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,750
Boss!

46
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,757
BOSS:
Come on! Come on!

47
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,658
Listen, Boss!
A girl came--

48
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,200
What? Not again!

49
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,531
Just when I get
one thing fixed--

50
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,764
Listen to me!
A girl came down--

51
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,863
BOSS: Tighten
the second valve, will you?

52
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,464
There's no time to lose!

53
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,204
Ah, this machinery's too old!

54
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,945
- I think I need a bigger wrench!
- I'll get it!

55
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:45,952
Go run the hoist
while I fix this!

56
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,118
Huh?

57
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,322
- You think you can do it?
- Yeah! Here!

58
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,991
BOSS: Just stay calm
and use your head!

59
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,466
Right.

60
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,818
- Hit the brake!
- What?

61
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,328
PAZU: Whew.

62
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,989
Well, how'd it go, boys?

63
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,159
No silver,
not even any trace of tin.

64
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,328
We're just not having any luck.

65
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,837
Maybe we would
if we tried digging...

66
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,167
the mines just east of here.

67
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,172
I don't know.

68
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,799
Those mines are worse
than this one.

69
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,605
We just have to start
all over again.

70
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:40,169
Let's call it a day.
Good night.

71
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,681
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

72
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,585
Shut off the boiler, Pazu.

73
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,891
We're not gonna find
anything today.

74
00:09:56,964 --> 00:10:01,765
If things keep going like this.
we'll all be starving soon.

75
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,066
And, Pazu, maybe you can oil
that blasted machine!

76
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,868
- OK!
- Thanks. Good night.

77
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,272
PAZU: 'Night!

78
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,914
SHALULU: Mom, it's no use.
Let's call it off.

79
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,220
There's too much cloud cover.
It's too dark!

80
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,385
- What?!

81
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,485
Mom, don't worry.
I'll find her!

82
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,029
DOLA: We'll all find her!

83
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,044
Ohh!

84
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,619
PAZU: Hello!

85
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,885
It's about time you got up!

86
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,453
How are you feeling?

87
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,662
Hi, there!
My name's Pazu.

88
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,465
I'm really glad to see
you're doing all right.

89
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:25,766
You had me worried there.

90
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,501
Go ahead. Feed them.

91
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,270
- Don't be shy.
- Aah!

92
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,946
These guys are really happy
we have a visitor.

93
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:38,911
Well, thank goodness.

94
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,919
You laugh
like a regular person.

95
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,750
The way you fell from the sky...

96
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,757
I thought that maybe you were
an angel or something.

97
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,759
Thank you very much
for saving me.

98
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,692
Oh, I'm sorry.
My name's Sheeta.

99
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,923
Sheeta--
what a beautiful name.

100
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,465
I had to catch you.
You were just floating.

101
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,296
- What? Floating?
- Yeah.

102
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,836
Well, I remember an airship...

103
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,270
but I can't remember
anything else.

104
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,864
That's all you remember?

105
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,341
Mm-hmm. I'm not sure
how I survived.

106
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,709
PAZU: Hmm.

107
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,372
Well, I think I might
have an idea about that.

108
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,382
May I see your necklace
for a second?

109
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,042
This?

110
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,684
My grandmother gave it to me.

111
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:19,782
It's been in my family
for generations.

112
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,293
Wow, it's beautiful.

113
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,988
Could you hold this?

114
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,800
- Oh.

115
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,733
Thanks. Heh.

116
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,968
Get a load of this! Watch!

117
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,566
Here I go-o-o!

118
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:46,009
Pazu! Are you all right?

119
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,788
Unh!

120
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,192
Ha! Well, so maybe
I had the wrong idea...

121
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,893
about this necklace. Aah!

122
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,269
Oh!

123
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,184
Aah! Aah!

124
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,152
Whoa!

125
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:25,523
I'm so sorry, Pazu.

126
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,356
- Ohh.
- Are you OK?

127
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,520
I'm fine.

128
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,530
Oh, you scared me.
Does it hurt much?

129
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,032
Are you kidding?
If my head were any harder...

130
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,226
you could use it
as a cannonball.

131
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,870
Whoa! The kettle!
It must be boiling over!

132
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,434
Come on! Let's go!
Follow me! This way!

133
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,208
I'll get breakfast started.
You can wash up over there.

134
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,049
There's a clean towel, too.

135
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,584
SHEETA: Great. Thank you.

136
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,664
"Laputa."

137
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,439
Sheeta!
It's time for breakfast!

138
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,589
My father took that picture
from an airship.

139
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,988
He loved to fly.

140
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,356
It's Laputa--
the floating island.

141
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,395
An island
that floats in the sky?

142
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,624
Yep. Most people think
it's just a legend...

143
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,427
but my dad actually saw it.

144
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,730
That's a picture
of his airship.

145
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,886
PAZU: It looked like a castle
just floating there in the sky.

146
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:08,257
He said it was the most amazing
thing he'd ever seen.

147
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,299
And that's the only picture
he was able to take.

148
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,706
But take
a look at this, Sheeta.

149
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:25,472
Dad kept a journal,
and he made all sorts...

150
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,137
of drawings of Laputa, see?

151
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,238
There it is.
He drew the castle...

152
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:32,045
and also what he thought
the people'd look like.

153
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,313
He was sure the castle
was filled with treasure...

154
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,753
but nobody believed him.

155
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,154
They called him a liar.

156
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,887
Being called a liar
is what killed him.

157
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,259
But I am gonna prove that
my dad was no liar, Sheeta.

158
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,270
As soon as I'm done building
this plane...

159
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:56,274
I'm gonna take off
and find Laputa myself.

160
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,411
Hmm.

161
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,849
Ohh!

162
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,683
It's a real automobile!
You don't see many of those around here!

163
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,087
- Those people are pirates Pazu.
- What?

164
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,557
SHEETA: They're the ones
who attacked the airship.

165
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,562
They're probably after you.
Come on!

166
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:24,865
PAZU: Good morning!
Good-bye!

167
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,701
LOUIE: Hold it! Wait up!

168
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,798
PAZU: Yes?
How can I help you, mister?

169
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,775
Young man, query--

170
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,311
Have you seen a little girl
around here?

171
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,606
Let me see now.

172
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,012
There are about 100 girls
in this town. Which one?

173
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:37,515
Thanks for nothing, kid!

174
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:38,744
Bye!

175
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,787
They are definitely
after you, Sheeta.

176
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,491
Louie, go tell your mother!
She's in disguise!

177
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,857
So, she's in disguise!
Go tell my mother!

178
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,160
Haven't seen her.

179
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,671
That's what you keep saying...

180
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,730
but I want you think
really hard about it.

181
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,070
PAZU: Boss!

182
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,906
Boss!

183
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,405
She'd be about the age
of those two.

184
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,813
Aah! Oh, no!

185
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,319
There she is!
Don't let her get away!

186
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,582
Now!

187
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,987
Yeow!

188
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,754
Hey, boss, they're pirates!
They're after her!

189
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,466
Pirates? I want to see!

190
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,629
You can stop right there,
my friend.

191
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,262
Think you're tough, don't you?

192
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,637
- I'm tough enough.
- We'll see about that.

193
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,643
BOSS: Just go away.
We're honest folks here.

194
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:40,008
What did you do that for?

195
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,671
Quick, leave from the back.

196
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,181
No, I'm gonna fight 'em!

197
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,149
Pazu, what if you wind up
getting yourself hurt?

198
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,810
So?!

199
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,820
So, somebody's got
to protect your friend.

200
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:52,153
Hmm? Oh. Mm-hmm.

201
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,193
Why don't you get
out of our way?

202
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,285
Why don't you
just try and make me?

203
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,954
Maybe I will!

204
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,625
HENRI: Oh, yeah!
Make your shirt explode.

205
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,570
MAN: Hey, Boss, show him
what you're made of!

206
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,877
Ha ha ha!

207
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,890
Mm-hmm.

208
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,119
MAN: You showed him, boss!

209
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,889
I'm not mending that,
I hope you know.

210
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,199
Take that, you landlubber!

211
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,928
- He took it.
- He certainly did.

212
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,901
LOUIE: Come on, Shalulu!

213
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,000
Give him
something for nothing!

214
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,476
Ooh!

215
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,069
You go get him, boss!

216
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,170
Unh!

217
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,842
BOTH: He said Mom was ugly,
now go get him!

218
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,009
- Oh!
- Raah!

219
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,484
That's it! Get him!

220
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,043
- That's it!
- Punch him!

221
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,850
Come on, you got it!

222
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,414
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Hey, loudmouth!

223
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:01,790
No... Unh!

224
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,159
Get in there!
Give him a right, a left!

225
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,702
DOLA: Whoa! Oh...

226
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,012
They're headed for
the railroad tracks.

227
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:28,110
Let's move it!

228
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,759
Hey! Hey!

229
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,557
We're gonna jump on, Sheeta!

230
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,257
SHEETA: Right! Unh!

231
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,061
PAZU: That's it!

232
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,568
- Come on!
- Unh!

233
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,628
DRIVER: Hey, Pazu,
who's your friend there?

234
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,732
PAZU: Her name is Sheeta!
Pirates are after us!

235
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,342
- It's the Dola gang!
- Pirates?

236
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,939
Can you drop us at the police
station in the next town?

237
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,950
DRIVER: Sure.
Help me stoke up the engine!

238
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,111
PAZU: Will do!

239
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,489
- Huh?
- Hey, it's Mom!

240
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,961
You chowderheads!
Get your brother and hop on!

241
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,466
But Sheeta's hiding
inside that house.

242
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,333
Lame-brain! They made an escape.
Now, step on it!

243
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:19,632
They escaped?

244
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,367
- I want to come!
- Mommy!

245
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,174
Unh! Hey!

246
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,512
Well...

247
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,566
Hey, Pazu, here they come!

248
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,333
Can't this engine go any faster?

249
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,602
This is the best she'll do!
She's old!

250
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,903
Floor it! Move over!

251
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:12,554
I'd really prefer
to be in the car, Mother!

252
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,041
DRIVER: Increase the steam!
They're gaining on us!

253
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,543
- We got 'em!

254
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,546
- Yaah!

255
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,548
We need you in here!

256
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,018
- Help with the fire!
- OK!

257
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,919
Aah!

258
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,585
Yaah!

259
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,023
Uh-oh!

260
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,258
Unh! Charge!

261
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,924
- Look out!
- Aah!

262
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,966
DOLA: Come on!
Get 'em! Get 'em!

263
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,221
Hey, come back here!

264
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:22,651
You'll get yours!
Don't just stand there!

265
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,854
Push this train
over the cliff!

266
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,090
BOTH: What?

267
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:28,998
DRIVER: Ha ha ha!
We sure showed them!

268
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,332
- I can do it now.
- You were amazing!

269
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,576
- Heave! Heave!
- And heave...

270
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,406
- Wait.
- And stop.

271
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:45,317
You think maybe it's Muska?

272
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,820
Yeah it's Muska, all right.
We gotta find those kids.

273
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,796
Huh?

274
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,365
Well, What do you know about that?

275
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,029
It's the army to the rescue!

276
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,203
Hey! Could you kindly help
these two young people?

277
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,841
Pirates have been
chasing them all day!

278
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,427
Huh? What's the matter?

279
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,826
Good-bye, Pazu!

280
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,455
Young lady, come back here!

281
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,467
- Unh!
- Oh!

282
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,127
Sheeta, wait!

283
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:39,501
Halt, or I'll shoot!

284
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,039
- Aah!
- Ow!

285
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:46,035
LOUIE:
It's an armored train, Mother!

286
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,376
DOLA: And we're
the Dola gang! Attack!

287
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:51,211
PAZU: No! Hey! Sheeta!

288
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:53,616
SHEETA: Don't follow me!
You'll get hurt!

289
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,483
Aah!

290
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,020
ALL: Whoa!

291
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,668
Aah!

292
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,231
- Don't let go!

293
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,375
Come on!

294
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,028
- Where are they, Mother?

295
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,030
DOLA: Be quiet!
Just watch them.

296
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,209
SHALULU: Ohh!

297
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,810
Ahh!

298
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:02,220
Huh? Oh!

299
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:05,619
Sheeta, we're floating!

300
00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:09,087
You see?

301
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,129
This was what happened
the first time I saw you.

302
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,597
See that?
It's the power of the crystal.

303
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,963
I knew it!

304
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,129
I knew there was something
special about your necklace!

305
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,072
- Oh!
- Whoo!

306
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,346
The necklace will let us down
nice and easy.

307
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,694
Boys, I want that crystal!

308
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,700
SOLDIER: Fire!

309
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,775
It's fantastic!
Incredible!

310
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,677
I must have that crystal!

311
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,095
It's going out!

312
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,398
Ah, wait. Just a minute.

313
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,209
I guess your necklace
must come to life...

314
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,747
whenever you're in trouble.

315
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,078
PAZU:
Wow, that's a long way up.

316
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,052
I hope they're all right--

317
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,419
your boss and his wife
and that nice train engineer.

318
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,616
My friends are all miners.

319
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,283
They can take
care of themselves.

320
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,055
I wouldn't worry about them
if I were you.

321
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,595
Come on, Sheeta. Let's go.

322
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,065
This has been
a mining town...

323
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,227
as long as
anyone can remember.

324
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,534
Most of these tunnels
aren't even used anymore.

325
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,012
PAZU: Here you go.

326
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,177
Thank you. I'm glad
you brought some food.

327
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,811
I'm starving.

328
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:18,186
And for dessert, I've got
a green apple and some candy.

329
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,954
Really? You know that bag of yours
must be magic.

330
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,154
It's always
got just what we need.

331
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,234
Ha!

332
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,503
Mmm!

333
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,605
Sheeta, where exactly
do you come from?

334
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,171
I come from Gondoa--
deep in the northern mountains.

335
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,241
I used to live there
with my parents...

336
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,309
and we were very happy.

337
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,379
But when my mother
and father died...

338
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,755
I was all alone.

339
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,152
The only thing
that kept me going...

340
00:29:57,229 --> 00:30:00,687
was the farm and
taking care of my animals.

341
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:03,758
But one day.
everything changed.

342
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:06,805
That was the day
the men came and took me away.

343
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,640
Whoa, wait a minute.
They kidnapped you?

344
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:13,837
Yes.

345
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,279
It was that man
in the dark glasses.

346
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:17,781
I wonder who that guy is...

347
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,750
and what
he's doing with the army.

348
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,121
I think Dola and that man
are both after your necklace.

349
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,919
I think you're right,
but I had no idea...

350
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,755
my crystal was
so incredibly powerful.

351
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,889
It's been in my family
as long as I can remember.

352
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,399
Mother gave it to me
before she died...

353
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:37,129
and she told me
never to show it...

354
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:39,000
or give it away to anyone.

355
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,971
PAZU: Huh.

356
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,574
We orphans should stick
together, don't you think?

357
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,167
SHEETA: I'm really sorry.

358
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,736
It's my fault getting you
mixed up in all this.

359
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,247
PAZU: Are you kidding?

360
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,045
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

361
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:54,847
I wouldn't miss an adventure
like this for the world!

362
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,451
What?

363
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,695
Are you some sort of goblin
come to torment me?

364
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,900
It's Uncle Pom!
Don't worry. He's a friend.

365
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,705
Uncle Pom,
boy, am I glad to see you!

366
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,904
I can't see you
clearly yet, goblin...

367
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,278
but you sound like Pazu.

368
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,374
And if these old eyes
don't deceive me...

369
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,282
there's a she-goblin with you.

370
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,820
There are pirates
chasing us, Uncle Pom.

371
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,016
- Oh?
- The army's right behind them.

372
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:36,494
Ha ha ha! That sounds
absolutely splendid!

373
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,672
UNCLE POM: The tea is ready.
Help yourself.

374
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,766
SHEETA: Thank you.
This is great.

375
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:54,108
Don't you get lonely down here
underground, Uncle Pom?

376
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,205
Never, my dear.

377
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,012
All of these rocks
are my friends.

378
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,915
They often talk to me.

379
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,887
Ever since last night, they've been
especially restless.

380
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:06,948
- The rocks talk to you?
- Oh, yes, Pazu.

381
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,926
The earth
speaks to all of us...

382
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,929
and if we listen.
we can understand.

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,664
The rocks speak
in a very small voice.

384
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,044
Huh? Oh, my!

385
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,952
- Whoa!

386
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,169
Amazing!

387
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,299
Pazu, look above us!

388
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:59,105
Huh? Wow!

389
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,583
It was just a hunk of rock
a while ago.

390
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,852
SHEETA: Oh, my!

391
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:16,895
UNCLE POM: The answer
lies inside these rocks.

392
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,327
Let me show you.

393
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:27,762
SHEETA: Pazu, you see?

394
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,033
All the rocks around here
contain a bit of aetherium.

395
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,341
PAZU: Really?

396
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:38,144
Mankind once knew
how to mine aetherium...

397
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,276
but no longer.

398
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,484
Wait!

399
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,125
Look, my stone's glowing!

400
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,286
Well, goodness!
Bless my soul!

401
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,853
That's a pure
aetherium crystal!

402
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,193
There hasn't been one...

403
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:58,362
since before
my great-grandfather's time.

404
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:01,804
No wonder
the rocks were restless.

405
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,468
This stone possesses
incredible power.

406
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,740
Legend has it
that only the people...

407
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,781
of the floating city of Laputa...

408
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,213
knew how to make
such crystals.

409
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,251
They made this crystal?

410
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:17,379
They used aetherium to make
Laputa float in the sky.

411
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:19,048
PAZU: I knew Laputa
wasn't just made up!

412
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,718
You see, Sheeta?
It's just like my dad said!

413
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,326
What's the matter?

414
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,029
I'm sorry, but would you
put that crystal away?

415
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,436
It's too strong for me.

416
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,838
Oh, sorry.

417
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,774
What is it, Uncle Pom?

418
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:53,590
Great-grandpa used to tell me
the rocks become restless...

419
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,651
when Laputa
appears over the mine.

420
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,162
Wow! So that must mean...

421
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,061
Laputa's over the mine
right now!

422
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:03,124
Listen! Sheeta, now I can prove
that the legend is true!

423
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:06,603
Sheeta, I must tell you
something.

424
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,866
SHEETA: Yes?

425
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,908
What is it?

426
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,911
That crystal
is extremely powerful...

427
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,004
but with a power
that rightfully belongs...

428
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,777
to the earth
from which it came.

429
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:21,081
To forget that,
and then to try to use...

430
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,882
the crystal's power
for selfish reasons...

431
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,287
will bring great unhappiness.

432
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:26,949
- You understand?
- Yes.

433
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:31,553
Your crystal should remind us
that we come from the earth...

434
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,962
and to the earth
we must return.

435
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:36,660
Come on, lighten up!

436
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:38,134
Two times already,
that crystal's gotten Sheeta...

437
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:39,966
out of some really big trouble.

438
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,630
And I have a feeling...

439
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,971
that crystal's gonna
help us find Laputa.

440
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,409
LOUIE: It's flying away!

441
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,817
HENRI: Mom, can we go back
to the ship now, please?

442
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,480
DOLA: It's too quiet.

443
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,421
We better just stay put
for the time being.

444
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,752
SHALULU:
Does this mean no lunch?

445
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,765
The coast is clear.
Let's go.

446
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,630
Uncle Pom, thank you.

447
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:12,226
Be careful, my dear.

448
00:36:30,656 --> 00:36:33,648
Wow, look up there!

449
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,332
Beyond that cloud
is a floating city...

450
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:55,039
that no one here on earth
believes exists.

451
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:59,140
But I swear--I am going
to be the one to prove it!

452
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,617
- Pazu?
- Huh?

453
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:04,554
Listen, there's something
I haven't told you yet.

454
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,786
You see my family has a very old
traditional name...

455
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,488
and when the stone
was passed on to me...

456
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,689
I inherited that name.

457
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:17,701
And the name I inherited was
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

458
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,029
Laputa? You mean you're...

459
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,043
They found us, Sheeta!
Let's go!

460
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,410
- Head back to the mine!
- Stop them!

461
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:37,182
- Unh!
- Aah!

462
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,587
Hands up!

463
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,589
Don't you touch her!

464
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,426
- Let me go!
- Aah!

465
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,294
Oh, no!
Are you all right, Pazu?

466
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,061
You have to wake up, Pazu!

467
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,299
- Sir, we've captured them.
- And about time.

468
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,363
Ohh!

469
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:21,558
Huh?

470
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,500
Huh? Hey, let me out!

471
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:30,905
Unh!

472
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:33,575
Unh!

473
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,705
Where am I?

474
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:40,510
Unh!

475
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,780
SOLDIER: Forward, march!

476
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:58,332
Aah!

477
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,016
We're wasting time!

478
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:18,818
You twist an arm or two, and
I guarantee the girl will talk.

479
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,017
I respectfully disagree.

480
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:24,790
Such military tactics risk
wasting more time, general.

481
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,264
If my military tactics
had been used to begin with...

482
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,528
Dola wouldn't have had a chance
to interfere with us at all!

483
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:35,164
It was a military transmission
that the pirates decoded.

484
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,141
You've bungled things, sir.
and now I must fix them.

485
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,508
Your job, general...

486
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,139
is to mobilize the troops
when it becomes necessary.

487
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,616
Muska, just don't forget...

488
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,880
that the government put me
in charge of finding Laputa!

489
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:51,889
Don't forget that as
the government's secret agent...

490
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,585
I am in charge of you, general.

491
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:00,325
Blast.
I really hate that man.

492
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,670
Huh?

493
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,908
I trust you slept well?

494
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,578
Where is Pazu? Is he
all right? I want to see him!

495
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,746
Now, this is fit for a princess.

496
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,722
Don't worry, Sheeta.

497
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,522
Your friend is being treated as
if he were the guest of royalty.

498
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,529
I want you to see something
before you see him.

499
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,707
Please step inside.

500
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,527
What is it?

501
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,160
An artificial life form.

502
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,760
It's called a robot.

503
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,966
Laputa was just a legend
until this dropped from the sky.

504
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,138
Huh?

505
00:41:22,214 --> 00:41:24,444
- Aah!
- Oh! Ohh!

506
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,421
MUSKA:
Now the government wants me...

507
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,483
to unlock Laputa's secrets.

508
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,859
For example, what's this fellow
made of--metal or ceramics?

509
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,763
With our limited technology,
we have no idea.

510
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,664
But he does tell us one thing.

511
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,669
Come and see.

512
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:49,468
Don't be afraid, Sheeta. He's
really quite dead, you know.

513
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:57,479
Look there.

514
00:42:03,088 --> 00:42:04,555
It's the same emblem...

515
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:07,148
that decorates the fireplace
in your home.

516
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:09,022
And your crystal.

517
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:13,190
You see, Sheeta, this crystal
also comes from Laputa.

518
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,469
And I believe the powers
locked inside it...

519
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:22,029
are capable of leading a person
back to that city's treasures.

520
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:25,042
Then why?
Why don't you just take it?

521
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,670
Just take it and keep Laputa's
treasures for yourself...

522
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:31,182
but leave Pazu and me alone,
please!

523
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,747
You think I'm doing this
for money?

524
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,481
You understand nothing.

525
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:40,491
According to the legend,
the same technology...

526
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,084
that kept Laputa airborne
also made it...

527
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:47,598
a major power that once
dominated the entire planet.

528
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,033
If such a horrible thing
is still floating up there...

529
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,729
you can understand
what a threat it is...

530
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,533
to the peace of the world.

531
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:58,804
Sheeta,
the stone only works for you.

532
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,710
You must know of some way
to make the stone...

533
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,044
point out
the location of Laputa.

534
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:08,575
I really don't know anything.
Please let me see Pazu!

535
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:11,850
I don't want to see
any harm come to anyone...

536
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:15,120
but I simply can't control what
the military might do to him.

537
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,058
What?!

538
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,255
In the event
that you cooperate...

539
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:22,732
I'm sure whosever is in charge
will grant Pazu his freedom...

540
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:27,238
Lusheeta Toel Ul Laputa.

541
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,068
You know my real name.

542
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,337
"Ul" means "ruler" in Laputian.
"Toel" means "true."

543
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,378
You are the legitimate heir...

544
00:43:34,446 --> 00:43:37,074
to the throne of Laputa,
Princess Lusheeta.

545
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:52,253
Aah!

546
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,991
Unh!

547
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:58,262
SOLDIER: Let's go! Out!

548
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:02,264
Sheeta!

549
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,240
Are you all right, Pazu?

550
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,210
I'm OK, but what about you?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

551
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:10,578
Pazu, I'm so sorry. There's
been a grave misunderstanding.

552
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,584
We had no idea
how nobly you fought...

553
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,587
to protect our little Sheeta
from those awful pirates.

554
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,088
What's he talking about?

555
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:22,024
Pazu, do this for me.
Forget about Laputa.

556
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,856
What are you saying?

557
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,158
It's been decided
that the search for Laputa...

558
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:28,062
will be made secretly
by the army...

559
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:29,691
with Sheeta's cooperation.

560
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:30,996
Really, the best thing
you can do...

561
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,094
is forget
you ever heard of the place.

562
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,105
Forget about Laputa?

563
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,664
I'm sorry I caused you
so much trouble.

564
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:40,142
I hope someday
you can forgive me.

565
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,145
I can't forget! No way!

566
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,613
Laputa means too much
to both of us!

567
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:46,844
- Good-bye!
- Sheeta!

568
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,783
Aah! Come back!

569
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,844
Now, behave, little boy.
Use your head!

570
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:04,097
Here, take this--
a little something...

571
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:07,263
to show our appreciation
of your efforts.

572
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,233
Only you can do it.

573
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,801
Remember the words
that bring the crystal to life.

574
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:50,780
Keep your promise,
and you too will be free.

575
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,899
Unh! Huh?

576
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:22,572
Hey, mommy! Mommy, it's Pazu!
Pazu's outside!

577
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:25,810
Oh, my! Pazu!

578
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,216
Where have you been?

579
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,810
We were all very worried
about you, Pazu.

580
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:32,550
What happened to your friend?

581
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:35,821
- It's over now.
- What?

582
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,555
Pazu! Come back!

583
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:44,800
Unh!

584
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:18,298
Welcome home, sonny.

585
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:21,998
PAZU: Get out! Aah!
Get out, or I'll throw you out!

586
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,700
This is my house!

587
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:26,903
Oh, you don't scare me.

588
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,344
You can't even protect
one small girl!

589
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,506
What do you mean?

590
00:47:30,582 --> 00:47:32,015
Hey, Mom,
can I keep this money?

591
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,610
Up and sold the little girl,
did you? I know your type.

592
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:37,484
PAZU: You don't know
what you're talking about!

593
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,183
They offered you money,
and you took it, didn't you?

594
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:43,694
I only left
because Sheeta told me to!

595
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,058
That's why.

596
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:49,862
So, you believed her,
and you came back here, right?

597
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:52,402
You're just a scared little boy
who runs away!

598
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,097
Says you!

599
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:56,402
You don't even have the guts to
stand up to Muska and the army!

600
00:47:56,474 --> 00:48:01,411
He who turns and runs away can
steal the treasure another day!

601
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,909
Don't you think
it's kind of strange...

602
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,383
that the army's gotten into
the kidnapping business?

603
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,155
Do you really think
they'll keep her alive?

604
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,418
Don't you see that
they forced her to make a deal?

605
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,926
Huh?

606
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:23,833
She saved your life. Get it?

607
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,097
LOUIE: Mommy, you amaze me.
How do you know these things?

608
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:31,005
DOLA: Well, you can't be
a sensitive woman like me...

609
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,770
without leaning a few things.

610
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:34,573
Sheeta and I
are exactly alike--

611
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:37,444
all warm and mushy and sensitive.

612
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,574
Now, so when you boys
get married...

613
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,209
You go find a gal like her.

614
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:44,278
Huh?
She's gonna end up like mama?

615
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,453
- Aw, Mom, that was--
- The ham! Gimme that!

616
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,624
Hmm.

617
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,966
Well, it won't work
changing the code on me.

618
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:02,336
They're calling
for air destroyer Goliath.

619
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:12,978
They're planning
to take off with Sheeta.

620
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,383
We've got to hurry,
or it'll be too late!

621
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,978
Come on, boys! Stop eating!

622
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:20,388
I'm going!

623
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,052
Wait! Are you going
to rescue Sheeta?

624
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,823
No, you little squirt.
We want her crystal.

625
00:49:25,897 --> 00:49:27,057
Wait a minute!
You've got to have Sheeta...

626
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,462
to make
the aetherium crystal work.

627
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:29,625
Otherwise, it's useless!

628
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:32,636
Please let me come with you!
I need to save her!

629
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,638
Sheeta means everything to me.

630
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:36,139
You know something?

631
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,641
You're acting like
a sniveling little crybaby.

632
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:41,008
Maybe you're right. I should
have protected Sheeta...

633
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,979
but instead,
I was stupid and angry.

634
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:44,139
But let me come with you...

635
00:49:44,215 --> 00:49:45,307
and I swear
I'll protect her this time!

636
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,146
Pazu loves Sheeta

637
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,243
- Be quiet!

638
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,345
Hmm.

639
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,088
Guess you'll be useful in
getting Sheeta to cooperate.

640
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,997
You might never
come back here again, Pazu.

641
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:04,159
I know.

642
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,135
- Ready for what might happen?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:10,140
We leave here in one minute!

644
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:21,011
Now, you guys be good.

645
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:30,390
- Here, fasten this.
- Right!

646
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,363
Let's rendezvous
at the Tiger Moth.

647
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,220
What a superb ship!

648
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,788
Muska, has the girl
surrendered the information?

649
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,197
It will take a little more time.

650
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,895
More time?

651
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,994
Well, you'll have plenty
of that aboard Goliath.

652
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:16,267
We set out with her
at first light.

653
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,920
Hurry! We have to get there
before sun up!

654
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:46,929
Sheeta.

655
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:13,960
Well, well, now,
what shall we do?

656
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:20,734
Sheeta, maybe grandma
should teach you a spell--

657
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,365
one that will help you
when you're in trouble.

658
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:24,931
A spell?

659
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,910
Yes, my dearest.
An ancient secret spell.

660
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:33,918
Leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

661
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:36,920
Leetay a...

662
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:39,684
The words mean "save me."

663
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:43,693
"save me
and revive the eternal light."

664
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:48,357
So, leetay latuparita ulus
arialos balu netoreel.

665
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,398
Leetay latuparita ulus...

666
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,961
arialos balu netoreel.

667
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,910
Aah! Aah!

668
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:09,415
Aah!

669
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:21,064
Ahh. I knew it!

670
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,467
It's the sacred light!

671
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,338
The ancient documents were true!
It's not just a legend!

672
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,503
What are you talking about?

673
00:53:34,579 --> 00:53:36,945
Aaah!

674
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,948
Oh!

675
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:42,452
Tell me the spell!
What are the secret words?

676
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,124
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

677
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,901
- Huh?
- Huh?

678
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:12,382
I'm telling you,
this thing is alive!

679
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,385
Do you hear me? Alive!

680
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:21,456
What?

681
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:27,129
GUARD: Help, it's alive!
And it's after us!

682
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:30,361
- Run for your lives!
- It's the robot! Go! Run!

683
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:36,196
It's come back to life!

684
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:40,233
Hurry! Hurry! Sound the alarm!
Quick! Quick!

685
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,438
SOLDIER: He's moving!

686
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:47,751
- What's happening?
- Sir, it's the robot.

687
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,629
It's coming toward us!

688
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:07,132
Shut the fire door! Hurry!

689
00:55:11,575 --> 00:55:13,202
- Pull back!
- Look out!

690
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,615
- Aah!
- The power!

691
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,250
Yes, I understand.

692
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,250
It's your crystal.

693
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,058
The force
of the sacred light...

694
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,757
has brought the robot
back to life!

695
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,392
The way to Laputa
has been opened!

696
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:39,959
Let me go!

697
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:44,265
- Ohh!
- Unh!

698
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,142
Aah!

699
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:00,816
It's going to fly!

700
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,494
Aah!

701
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,401
Oh!

702
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,513
Oh! Oh!

703
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,105
Oh! Oh!

704
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,735
It's Laputa.

705
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,018
Finally.
I now know the way to Laputa.

706
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:04,952
Hurry! No time to waste!

707
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:06,512
What do you mean, robot?

708
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,524
I want to know who's trying
to blow up my fortress!

709
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,854
Are you there?
Somebody answer me now!

710
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,865
- We're ready.
- You're connected now, Colonel.

711
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,527
This is Colonel Muska.
We have an emergency.

712
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,092
You'll take your orders
from me now.

713
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:21,604
Huh?

714
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,555
Hurry! I need that shell now!

715
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:01,303
- Fire!
- Fire!

716
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,239
Aah!

717
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,461
Let's get up there now!

718
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,601
- We demolished it!
- We got him!

719
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,966
Go get the girl!

720
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,436
- Over there!
- Yes, sir.

721
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,371
SOLDIER: Make sure
it doesn't move, now.

722
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,841
Is she dead?

723
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,537
Hey, get up.

724
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:38,145
Nah, she's only fainted.

725
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,307
- Come on.
- Oh, no!

726
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,689
Aah!

727
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,422
Wow

728
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,094
Must be some kind of war
goin' on!

729
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,832
- Take her down, Dola!
- Call me captain!

730
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,374
Whee!

731
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:39,841
Ha ha ha!

732
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,073
Just keep your big head down,
Shalulu!

733
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:00,453
Huh?

734
01:00:02,866 --> 01:00:05,096
Stop it!
You're destroying everything!

735
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:07,103
Please, stop!

736
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:18,147
Captain Mother, Goliath
is moving! Goliath is moving!

737
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:27,922
If we stay on this heading,
we'll be in the line of fire.

738
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,550
- Change course!
- Look! There she is!

739
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:30,753
- It's Sheeta!
- What?

740
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,326
- Where'd you see her?
- Steady as she goes, captain!

741
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,799
PAZU:
She's on top of that tower!

742
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,804
One for all and all for mom!

743
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:49,573
- Cover me!
- Good luck!

744
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,655
Sheeta!

745
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:06,953
My hand--take it!

746
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,760
Pazu!

747
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,499
I've gotta get in
a little closer, Dola!

748
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:16,005
Aah! Uhh!

749
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,337
Pazu!

750
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:22,539
But they're here to help me!
Please, put me down!

751
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:33,489
Aah!

752
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,865
Sheeta!

753
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,696
Uhh!

754
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,960
PAZU: Dola!

755
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,842
No! They're falling!

756
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:03,052
No.

757
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,417
Help!

758
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,388
Come on!

759
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:26,832
Oh, come on, pull up!

760
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,172
Uhh!

761
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,782
It's now or never, Pazu.

762
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:35,284
I'll take us in,
and you grab her.

763
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,649
PAZU: Right!

764
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,210
Over here!

765
01:02:38,288 --> 01:02:40,586
- OK, captain!
- Go!

766
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,285
What are you doing? Fools!
Don't let her escape!

767
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,556
Aaah!

768
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:54,137
An entire army,
and they're getting away!

769
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:01,234
It's not over.

770
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:17,458
Muska, Muska! What on earth
happened to the robot?

771
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:19,860
We destroyed it,
and the girl's gone.

772
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,057
What?! Ohh!

773
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,623
Look at this. It's a disaster.

774
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,602
I think we may have found
what you've been looking for.

775
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:30,799
Extinguish the fire!
Organize a pursuit team!

776
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,850
It still possesses
its sacred light...

777
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:52,055
pointing to Laputa.

778
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,324
You may now go tell
the general for me...

779
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,161
we will be departing on time.

780
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,468
Sheeta, you OK?

781
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:37,302
If I did something wrong...

782
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,968
I'd really like
to apologize for it, Sheeta.

783
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,738
DOLA: We all did
something wrong...

784
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:43,973
wastin' our time
on these two kids.

785
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:46,413
Here's your valley up ahead.

786
01:04:46,483 --> 01:04:48,474
I'll drop you off there,
and that'll be that.

787
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,849
It's allright.

788
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,855
Dola, will you let us sail
with you and the boys?

789
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,618
Call me captain, darn it!

790
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,522
I don't see what the heck's
in it for me...

791
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,060
since you've lost
the aetherium crystal!

792
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,891
We can work.

793
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:01,692
And I have to find out
the real truth...

794
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:04,393
about Laputa for myself,
captain.

795
01:05:09,106 --> 01:05:11,734
So, you're not interested
in money...

796
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,038
but you want to find out
the truth about Laputa.

797
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,806
Heh heh. Well, I guess
there's worse reasons...

798
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:17,471
for you wanting
to become a pirate.

799
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:19,345
LOUIE: Mother,
I say let 'em come along.

800
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,442
DOLA: Tow the line and
work hard, or overboard you go.

801
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,611
PAZU: Yes, captain.

802
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,985
Yes! No more
swabbin' the decks! Hooray!

803
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,455
I won't have
to wash the dishes!

804
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:30,891
I've peeled my last potato!
Yee-haw!

805
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:34,727
- Whoopee!
- Whee!

806
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:36,732
CHARLES:
Sheeta, can you make pudding?

807
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,062
I love pudding!

808
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,228
I get to lick the spatula!

809
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,295
And I like chocolate cake
with that--

810
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,237
Oh, what's that frosting?
It's kind of pink and swirly.

811
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:47,436
Will you shut up?
Ah, what can I tell you?

812
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:48,978
They just really like dessert.

813
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,786
SHEETA AND PAZU: Whoa!

814
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,190
And disembark.

815
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,988
Uhh! Wow, what is this ship
made out of, cloth?

816
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,260
And don't you rip it!

817
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,426
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

818
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,470
Come on, we'll go topside.

819
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,870
Ohh!

820
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,209
DOLA: You're goin'
the wrong way! Come here!

821
01:06:56,279 --> 01:06:57,576
I don't like slow-pokes!

822
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:02,082
- Ohh!
- Pazu?

823
01:07:02,152 --> 01:07:03,710
DOLA: Come on, matey.
I haven't got all day.

824
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,880
LOUIE: Work, work, work.
Busy, busy, busy, busy.

825
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:08,288
Left, right, left, right.
You're not here to have fun.

826
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,727
Whoa. This engine room
is really amazing.

827
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,560
Is that what it's called?

828
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:18,123
Hey, papa! Where are you?!

829
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:19,395
Oh!

830
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:23,132
Hey, pop, I finally found you
an assistant!

831
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:25,800
Stop yelling at me!
I can hear you!

832
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,673
Believe me,
sometimes I wish I couldn't.

833
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,742
Uh, hurry up. He is
even tougher than my mother.

834
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,387
It's too narrow. I can't reach.

835
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,790
It's OK. I got it.

836
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,088
- What's your name?
- Pazu.

837
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:51,223
But the beam from the crystal
was pointing directly due east.

838
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:53,166
Are you sure about this?

839
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:56,603
Yes, I'm sure I could see
the sun rising from the tower.

840
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,903
You know, it's the end
of grass-cutting season...

841
01:07:58,975 --> 01:08:00,909
so the sun rose
not from due east...

842
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:02,569
but a little further south.

843
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,580
The light was pointing
to the left of the hill...

844
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:06,377
from which the sun rose,
you see?

845
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,680
Pretty smart.
Found anything yet?

846
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,879
Haven't found a single thing,
captain.

847
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:12,216
DOLA: They're
jamming the airwaves...

848
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,223
so we can't find 'em.
the flying devils.

849
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,283
Mom, how can we catch them when
they're faster than we are?

850
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,420
Well, It looks like we're cruising
on the windward side of 'em.

851
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:23,398
So if we manage
to ride the trade wind...

852
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,300
Let's see. According
to my calculations...

853
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:29,600
with wind velocity at ten...

854
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:33,109
looks to me
like we'll catch 'em.

855
01:08:33,176 --> 01:08:35,610
Attention, all hands!
Now hear this!

856
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,978
Goliath is already underway
for Laputa.

857
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:41,040
We're gonna set sail
and go after them.

858
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,551
If we can catch the wind...

859
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,814
we'll be on their heels
by tomorrow.

860
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:48,380
The first man to spy Goliath
will receive ten gold coins.

861
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,891
That's good money!

862
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,554
And if the stories we've heard
about Laputa are true...

863
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,891
there'll be enough treasure...

864
01:08:53,964 --> 01:08:55,659
to make an honest pirate
of us all.

865
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:58,667
Ha ha! All right!
All hands aboard!

866
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,794
Look alive and get to work!

867
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,600
Let her rip!

868
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:18,287
Course, ninety-eight degrees.
Velocity, fifty.

869
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:51,211
Now you gotta start
dressing like a real pirate.

870
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:53,848
Let's see... here.

871
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:06,695
And this is
where you'll be working.

872
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,801
DOLA: This is the galley.
I want it shipshape...

873
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,004
sparkling clean, and
ready for action in one hour.

874
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:18,013
- That's an order.
- But I--

875
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,983
The boys get awful hungry,
so you'll serve 5 meals a day.

876
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,689
You blubberheads!
I'm not runnin' a luxury cruise!

877
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,887
Now get to work!

878
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:39,230
Mmm.

879
01:11:01,658 --> 01:11:02,750
Hmm?

880
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:04,817
Hmm.

881
01:11:04,895 --> 01:11:06,021
Hmm?

882
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:25,580
SHEETA: Come in.

883
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:32,546
I'm afraid I'm still cooking.
Nothing's ready yet.

884
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:36,251
It took me a long time
to clean everything up.

885
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:39,261
- Ahem.
- Uh, yes? What is it?

886
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:42,089
Uh...

887
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:43,757
Yes?

888
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,596
I finished my work
for the moment...

889
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:47,660
and I've come to offer you
my help.

890
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,364
Well, that's kind of you.

891
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:51,464
Would you please hand me
those plates over there?

892
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,771
With pleasure,
my little ang-- ohh!

893
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:59,781
I thought you said
you had a stomach ache.

894
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,215
I'm in love with you!

895
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:03,775
- You?
- Hello.

896
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,083
- Move!
- Too crowded.

897
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,021
Hey, what do I look like,
a chair?

898
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:09,490
Hi. Is there anything I can do?

899
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,288
- Huh?
- Hey!

900
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,200
What's come over you, my dear?

901
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:24,297
It's not like you to challenge
a ship like Goliath.

902
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:26,308
You know,
the odds are against you.

903
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:29,106
I'm after treasure. That's all.

904
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,910
Heh heh heh. I must admit,
those kids are cute.

905
01:12:32,983 --> 01:12:35,508
What do you mean by that,
you old fool?

906
01:12:35,585 --> 01:12:37,280
Nothing.
But that little girl...

907
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:39,845
does remind me of you
not so long ago.

908
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:41,686
- Who asked ya?
- Nobody.

909
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:44,318
- Oh, look. Checkmate.
- Huh?

910
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:45,861
MAN: Fabulous!

911
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,664
Does anyone want any more?

912
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:55,068
I do believe I will have
a second helping.

913
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:56,400
- Yes!
- I want some more!

914
01:13:15,614 --> 01:13:17,377
Come on, young pup.

915
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:18,746
Huh?

916
01:13:20,019 --> 01:13:22,112
Time to go on duty.

917
01:13:22,187 --> 01:13:23,745
It's cold. Take this.

918
01:13:25,824 --> 01:13:27,052
Huh?

919
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,036
- I'll take over.
- Thank you!

920
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:53,911
Huh?

921
01:13:56,488 --> 01:13:58,786
Sheeta!

922
01:13:58,857 --> 01:14:02,054
Ohh. Whoa!

923
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:04,823
Ohh! That was exciting.

924
01:14:04,897 --> 01:14:07,422
Wow! You can see forever.

925
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:18,708
Ohh.

926
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:21,302
Sheeta? Here.

927
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:25,912
PAZU: You OK?

928
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:27,577
SHEETA: That's better.

929
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:31,927
This is great.
Now we can keep watch together.

930
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:37,594
- Pazu?
- Hmm?

931
01:14:37,663 --> 01:14:39,631
SHEETA: I'm really scared.

932
01:14:39,698 --> 01:14:42,826
To tell you the truth,
I don't want to go to Laputa.

933
01:14:44,536 --> 01:14:46,163
What do you mean?

934
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:47,603
Didn't you tell Dola
the truth?

935
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:50,568
SHEETA:
I didn't lie to Dola.

936
01:14:50,642 --> 01:14:53,304
What I said about
the light's direction is true.

937
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:55,973
But what if someone else dies?

938
01:14:56,048 --> 01:14:57,413
PAZU:
You mean, like the robot?

939
01:14:57,483 --> 01:14:59,417
SHEETA:
He died to save my life.

940
01:14:59,485 --> 01:15:01,419
I feel awful.

941
01:15:01,487 --> 01:15:05,150
All this is because of a spell
my grandmother taught me.

942
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,818
She taught me
all sorts of spells.

943
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:10,623
A spell to use when you're
looking for something...

944
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,425
a spell to cure sickness.

945
01:15:12,498 --> 01:15:15,831
There's even one she told me
I must never use.

946
01:15:15,901 --> 01:15:18,836
- What kind of spell?
- The spell of destruction.

947
01:15:18,904 --> 01:15:21,202
SHEETA: She said that
to give power to good spells...

948
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:23,298
I had to know evil ones, too.

949
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,639
But she told me
never to use them.

950
01:15:25,711 --> 01:15:28,305
I was so scared
when I leaned that spell...

951
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,574
I couldn't sleep.

952
01:15:29,648 --> 01:15:32,640
I didn't know the spells
were connected to my necklace.

953
01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:34,652
Uncle Pom was right
when he said...

954
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,156
that it was dangerous for us to
misuse the power of the crystal.

955
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,714
And what if Laputa
has the same power...

956
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:43,557
that can also be used
for great evil?

957
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:46,189
I wish
I'd thrown the crystal away.

958
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:48,028
But then we never
would have met.

959
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,331
And anyway, even if you had,
Laputa would still exist.

960
01:15:51,403 --> 01:15:54,566
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

961
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,040
You know, eventually,
some explorer or another...

962
01:15:57,109 --> 01:16:00,545
will come across the city
of Laputa one day and claim it.

963
01:16:00,612 --> 01:16:02,546
I can't say
I know what's best...

964
01:16:02,614 --> 01:16:04,548
but if Laputa really has
such great power...

965
01:16:04,616 --> 01:16:05,947
we can't let it
fall into the hands...

966
01:16:06,018 --> 01:16:08,646
of bad people like Muska.

967
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:13,885
And if we run away now,
Muska is gonna chase us forever.

968
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:16,120
But Pazu, I don't want you
to become a pirate...

969
01:16:16,195 --> 01:16:17,526
because of me.

970
01:16:17,596 --> 01:16:19,564
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

971
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:21,656
And don't worry.
Dola will understand.

972
01:16:21,733 --> 01:16:24,065
She's much nicer
than she pretends to be.

973
01:16:24,136 --> 01:16:25,967
And when
we've finally found it...

974
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:28,063
I promise you
we'll go back to Gondoa.

975
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,801
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

976
01:16:29,875 --> 01:16:33,072
The old house where you were
born, the valley and everything.

977
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:35,579
SHEETA:
Oh, Pazu.

978
01:16:35,647 --> 01:16:38,582
- Sheeta, what's that?

979
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,880
Right there. Under the ship.
See it?

980
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:50,688
Captain, it's Goliath--
right under our bow!

981
01:16:55,767 --> 01:16:57,701
Starboard rudder,
full speed ahead!

982
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,927
Why don't you go after them,
Muska? Get them!

983
01:17:31,003 --> 01:17:33,665
It's useless to look for them
in the cloud cover.

984
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:37,231
I don't need to waste my energy
on a wild-goose chase.

985
01:17:37,309 --> 01:17:40,244
Besides, we're running
right on schedule.

986
01:17:52,324 --> 01:17:54,656
It was farther north
than I figured.

987
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:57,160
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

988
01:17:57,229 --> 01:18:00,255
Everything will be ruined
if we lose track of Goliath.

989
01:18:00,332 --> 01:18:01,799
You've got good eyes.
so I want you...

990
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:03,334
to watch her
and keep us on course.

991
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:04,494
How do I do that, captain?

992
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,435
The crow's nest
can be made into a kite.

993
01:18:06,505 --> 01:18:07,995
See the metal handle
on the bulkhead?

994
01:18:08,073 --> 01:18:10,564
- I got it!
- Turn it clockwise!

995
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:15,410
DOLA: Hook it up
and then turn the handle.

996
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,005
That'll make the wings open.

997
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,987
Now extend the wire.

998
01:18:23,055 --> 01:18:25,114
You'll have to get the hang
of flying it on your own.

999
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:28,292
Are you up there,
Sheeta, my dear?

1000
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,624
- Yes.
- Best you come down right now.

1001
01:18:30,696 --> 01:18:32,061
SHEETA: Why?

1002
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,655
Because you're a girl--
a female! That's man's work!

1003
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,530
But you're female, captain!

1004
01:18:36,602 --> 01:18:38,763
I grew up in the mountains.
I can do this!

1005
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:39,929
Sheeta, no!

1006
01:18:40,005 --> 01:18:43,497
Be quiet.
And Pazu agrees with me.

1007
01:18:43,575 --> 01:18:45,600
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1008
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:47,645
All right, me hearty,
once you take off...

1009
01:18:47,713 --> 01:18:49,442
you'll have to use the phone
to communicate.

1010
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:53,313
SHEETA:
You mean this phone?

1011
01:18:53,385 --> 01:18:54,579
She is good.

1012
01:18:54,653 --> 01:18:57,588
Right. I think we're set.
Ready for takeoff.

1013
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:59,214
DOLA: Aye-aye. Anchors away!

1014
01:19:18,176 --> 01:19:20,371
I don't see them.

1015
01:19:20,445 --> 01:19:22,106
They must be hiding
under the cloud cover.

1016
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,546
DOLA: Perhaps. But they
could also be above you.

1017
01:19:24,616 --> 01:19:25,878
Keep your eyes peeled..

1018
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:28,886
- Roger! Whoa!
- Whoa!

1019
01:19:28,954 --> 01:19:30,080
PAZU: Hang on tight!

1020
01:19:36,762 --> 01:19:38,730
DOLA: What happened?

1021
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:40,697
PAZU:
Nothing. Just a gust of wind.

1022
01:19:40,766 --> 01:19:43,894
Didn't bother us at all.

1023
01:19:43,969 --> 01:19:46,563
We're fine.
We'll keep on watching.

1024
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:49,038
- Afraid?
- Uh-uh.

1025
01:19:49,107 --> 01:19:51,166
I got the hang
of this thing now.

1026
01:19:51,243 --> 01:19:52,710
Storm ahead.

1027
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:56,913
Sheeta, look in my bag.

1028
01:19:56,982 --> 01:19:58,472
There should be some rope
in there.

1029
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,847
OK.

1030
01:19:59,918 --> 01:20:02,250
Let's tie ourselves together.
This storm is gonna be rough.

1031
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:03,447
Good idea.

1032
01:20:06,525 --> 01:20:08,993
The mercury is dropping
really fast, mom.

1033
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:11,894
Blast our luck, boys.
What a rotten time for a storm.

1034
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:14,454
- When is sun-up?
- In one hour.

1035
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:32,240
Wait a minute.
Something's not right.

1036
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:34,581
The sun is coming up
in the wrong place.

1037
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:35,950
We're out of position.

1038
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:38,012
You're right. We're supposed
to be heading east, not north.

1039
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:40,115
We're going the wrong way.
Captain!

1040
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,456
Huh? What do you mean,
we're headed north?

1041
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:44,688
But the compass needle
is pointing east, mom.

1042
01:20:44,763 --> 01:20:46,492
There's something
confusing the compass...

1043
01:20:46,565 --> 01:20:48,157
and I want to know what it is!

1044
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:49,461
SHEETA:
There it is! Look!

1045
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,365
There what is? Is it Goliath?

1046
01:20:51,436 --> 01:20:52,630
PAZU:
No, it's a cloud...

1047
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:54,695
and I've only seen
one other like it.

1048
01:20:54,773 --> 01:20:56,138
A cloud?

1049
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:58,267
It's heading right for us!

1050
01:21:12,257 --> 01:21:13,519
That's it.

1051
01:21:13,592 --> 01:21:15,924
I'm not gonna captain my ship
into the eye of a hurricane!

1052
01:21:15,994 --> 01:21:19,361
Pull back! Pull back,
I tell you! All engines reverse!

1053
01:21:37,482 --> 01:21:39,416
We're being pulled
into the center of the storm!

1054
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:41,418
DOLA: Sorry, Pazu,
we can't help you!

1055
01:21:41,486 --> 01:21:43,386
You have to ride it out.
Good luck, sailor!

1056
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:50,652
I can't get it to turn!

1057
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:52,754
Put more backbone into it,
my boy!

1058
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:55,561
Dola, the engine can't take it!

1059
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:57,499
What do you want me
to do about it?

1060
01:21:57,569 --> 01:21:59,002
Just do what you can!

1061
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:01,837
Clouds are breaking up.

1062
01:22:08,447 --> 01:22:10,847
- Uhh! It's the ocean!
- Huh?

1063
01:22:22,828 --> 01:22:24,352
Pazu, it's a hurricane!

1064
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:26,897
I see it, captain!
We're going in!

1065
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:38,842
Wow.
It's just like dad said--

1066
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,878
two winds blowing
in opposite directions.

1067
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:47,441
DOLA: Shiver me timbers!
What a powerful storm!

1068
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:49,714
CHARLES: Mom, it's no use!
We'll be sucked in!

1069
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:52,848
If there's one thing
I can't stand, it's a quitter!

1070
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:54,983
PAZU:
Captain, Laputa's in there!

1071
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,391
Laputa's where?

1072
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:58,395
This is just the kind of storm
my father saw...

1073
01:22:58,463 --> 01:22:59,896
and Laputa's
in the middle of it!

1074
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:03,833
DOLA: It can't be.
It'd be smashed to pieces!

1075
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:06,132
- Pazu! Look there!
- Huh?

1076
01:23:08,707 --> 01:23:10,766
My boys, we have a dilemma.

1077
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:13,777
It's Goliath off the port bow!

1078
01:23:22,354 --> 01:23:24,447
We're gonna go
into the hurricane.

1079
01:23:24,523 --> 01:23:26,787
My dad made it through alive,
and so will we!

1080
01:23:26,858 --> 01:23:29,019
Ready?
Brace yourselves, gentlemen!

1081
01:23:29,094 --> 01:23:30,288
Aah!

1082
01:23:34,165 --> 01:23:36,133
Aah!

1083
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,265
We did it! Got 'em!

1084
01:23:44,342 --> 01:23:46,674
If we don't turn,
we'll hit that storm.

1085
01:23:46,745 --> 01:23:48,770
- All ahead full.
- Sir?

1086
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:52,783
MUSKA: The light is pointing
to the center of the whirlwind.

1087
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:56,617
Laputa is in that storm.
I won't retreat.

1088
01:23:56,688 --> 01:24:00,021
Now go straight ahead--
and that is an order, captain.

1089
01:24:12,203 --> 01:24:14,398
- Ready, Sheeta?
- Yes!

1090
01:24:45,103 --> 01:24:46,297
Huh?

1091
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:55,712
Father?

1092
01:27:07,879 --> 01:27:09,073
Huh?

1093
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:14,651
Sheeta!
Hey, are you all right?

1094
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,152
Wake up.

1095
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,016
Mm.

1096
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:23,722
Look.

1097
01:27:37,408 --> 01:27:39,467
Laputa.

1098
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:41,944
- Uhh!
- I'm sorry.

1099
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:44,072
- Here.
- Wait a minute.

1100
01:27:44,149 --> 01:27:46,083
It's a very tight knot.

1101
01:27:46,151 --> 01:27:48,585
And...my... uhh!

1102
01:27:48,653 --> 01:27:51,144
My hands are trembling.

1103
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:52,314
Whoa!

1104
01:28:12,977 --> 01:28:16,469
- Hoo-hoo!
- Ohh!

1105
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:18,914
- Aah!
- Whoa!

1106
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:33,090
Pretty birds.

1107
01:28:33,164 --> 01:28:35,291
They must live here, Pazu.

1108
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:38,636
Huh?

1109
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:48,001
I think he must be here
to meet you, Sheeta.

1110
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:50,047
But I don't have
the aetherium crystal.

1111
01:28:50,114 --> 01:28:51,945
Wait, I've gotta cut us loose.

1112
01:29:09,567 --> 01:29:11,057
PAZU: Hey, wait!

1113
01:29:11,135 --> 01:29:13,968
- You're gonna break that!
- Wait!

1114
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:16,029
Please, Mr.Robot,
don't do that.

1115
01:29:16,107 --> 01:29:18,075
We won't be able to go home
without it.

1116
01:29:33,925 --> 01:29:35,950
It's a bird's nest.

1117
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:38,587
That's why he's here.

1118
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:46,102
I'm so happy
the eggs are all right, Pazu.

1119
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,967
It must be his job
to take care of them.

1120
01:29:55,313 --> 01:29:57,713
- He says to follow him.
- How do you know?

1121
01:29:57,782 --> 01:29:59,044
I just know that's what he said!

1122
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,229
- Ohh!
- Look!

1123
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:24,798
It's a city.

1124
01:30:52,136 --> 01:30:54,434
I can't believe
we're inside a building.

1125
01:30:54,505 --> 01:30:56,097
Huh?

1126
01:30:58,676 --> 01:31:01,611
- Wow, the walls are invisible.
- Yeah.

1127
01:31:10,221 --> 01:31:12,280
I wonder what happened here.

1128
01:31:12,357 --> 01:31:14,985
This used to be a city
of advanced technology.

1129
01:32:13,885 --> 01:32:15,512
It must be a monument.

1130
01:32:15,586 --> 01:32:17,451
I wish I could read
what it says.

1131
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,653
Someone left some flowers.
Look.

1132
01:32:25,229 --> 01:32:28,096
Did you leave the flowers?

1133
01:32:29,367 --> 01:32:31,164
Hey, that's a different robot.

1134
01:32:35,740 --> 01:32:38,834
It looks like it's been
frozen there forever.

1135
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,207
Hey.

1136
01:32:50,455 --> 01:32:53,515
They must've been
protectors of the garden.

1137
01:32:54,892 --> 01:32:56,416
And they've kept on
guarding the place...

1138
01:32:56,494 --> 01:32:59,156
even long after
all the people have gone.

1139
01:33:11,576 --> 01:33:14,409
Oh! You've picked
another flower for the grave.

1140
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:16,777
How kind of you.

1141
01:33:18,749 --> 01:33:20,512
Oh, thank you.

1142
01:33:22,587 --> 01:33:24,350
You must be the only one left.

1143
01:33:24,422 --> 01:33:25,912
It looks like
all the other robots...

1144
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:27,423
stopped working a long time ago.

1145
01:33:35,233 --> 01:33:37,497
Ha!

1146
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:55,310
You know what, Sheeta?
I bet he's not lonesome at all.

1147
01:33:55,386 --> 01:33:58,844
He's got plenty of friends--
the animals and the birds.

1148
01:33:58,923 --> 01:34:00,948
He takes care of them.

1149
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:17,938
This way!

1150
01:34:28,953 --> 01:34:31,387
The army has destroyed
this part of the city!

1151
01:34:50,074 --> 01:34:53,237
SHEETA: I sure hope Dola
and the boys are all right.

1152
01:34:53,311 --> 01:34:56,474
PAZU: Me, too. Where are they?
Do you see them?

1153
01:34:56,547 --> 01:34:59,311
Wait! There they are!
They've got 'em prisoner!

1154
01:34:59,383 --> 01:35:01,317
SHEETA: They've been captured!
We've got to help them!

1155
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:03,353
If we don't, they'll hang 'em
from the yardarm!

1156
01:35:03,421 --> 01:35:06,549
- What'll we do?
- Come on.

1157
01:35:06,624 --> 01:35:08,353
Hurry!

1158
01:35:08,426 --> 01:35:10,360
Sir! Sir!

1159
01:35:10,428 --> 01:35:13,625
We've managed
to break down the wall, general.

1160
01:35:13,698 --> 01:35:16,360
Just a sample
of what we found inside.

1161
01:35:16,434 --> 01:35:19,369
The city
is full of treasure, sir.

1162
01:35:19,437 --> 01:35:21,064
- Mama!
- Whoa.

1163
01:35:21,138 --> 01:35:23,663
Wouldn't you like to have this?

1164
01:35:23,741 --> 01:35:26,767
Well, I've got a different
kind of necklace for you!

1165
01:35:26,844 --> 01:35:29,540
Have you radioed a report
on Laputa's discovery, Muska?

1166
01:35:29,614 --> 01:35:30,876
I was about to.

1167
01:35:30,948 --> 01:35:33,644
See if you can make it
difficult to decode.

1168
01:35:33,718 --> 01:35:36,687
And stop pocketing
those jewels, you scum!

1169
01:35:38,222 --> 01:35:41,749
MUSKA: The perfect thing to
throw those fools off the scent.

1170
01:35:58,276 --> 01:36:00,107
We're up so high.

1171
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,202
I hope you're good
at climbing trees, Sheeta.

1172
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:05,648
I've got a plan.

1173
01:36:07,618 --> 01:36:08,778
Ohh!

1174
01:36:38,616 --> 01:36:41,346
PAZU:
What a greedy pack of thieves.

1175
01:36:41,419 --> 01:36:44,388
We can't let them
destroy the garden, Pazu.

1176
01:36:44,455 --> 01:36:46,753
We have to find
the aetherium crystal.

1177
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:49,452
We have to find it.

1178
01:36:49,527 --> 01:36:51,518
It's the only way
we can protect the garden.

1179
01:36:51,595 --> 01:36:52,721
I was wondering why...

1180
01:36:52,797 --> 01:36:54,264
all of the storm clouds
just disappeared.

1181
01:36:54,332 --> 01:36:56,300
Then I realized
if they hadn't cleared up...

1182
01:36:56,367 --> 01:36:58,267
the army
couldn't have made a landing.

1183
01:36:58,336 --> 01:37:00,804
You think it was
because of my necklace?

1184
01:37:00,871 --> 01:37:02,338
I don't know for sure,
but I think...

1185
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:04,772
the power of the crystal
disintegrated that storm...

1186
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:07,208
and now the castle
has awakened from its sleep...

1187
01:37:07,278 --> 01:37:09,405
for whoever holds the crystal.

1188
01:37:11,349 --> 01:37:14,284
We can't let Muska figure out
how to use the crystal.

1189
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:17,219
If he does.
it'll be the end of everything.

1190
01:37:17,288 --> 01:37:19,688
But even if we can get
my grandmother's crystal back...

1191
01:37:19,757 --> 01:37:21,554
how can we use its power?

1192
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,820
The spell, Pazu!

1193
01:37:23,894 --> 01:37:25,919
The spell of destruction.

1194
01:37:25,996 --> 01:37:27,463
Sheeta, it may be the only way.

1195
01:37:27,531 --> 01:37:28,759
- Huh?

1196
01:37:38,175 --> 01:37:39,870
FIRST SOLDIER:
We need help over here!

1197
01:37:39,944 --> 01:37:42,970
SECOND SOLDIER: You, soldier!
Go find the general!

1198
01:37:43,047 --> 01:37:44,639
FIRST SOLDIER:
Somebody give us a hand!

1199
01:37:44,715 --> 01:37:46,114
SECOND SOLDIER:
Move now! You heard me!

1200
01:37:50,755 --> 01:37:52,120
Quickly!

1201
01:37:55,192 --> 01:37:57,160
We need to get down there.

1202
01:38:14,245 --> 01:38:15,837
I'll go first.

1203
01:38:15,913 --> 01:38:17,778
Right. Be careful.

1204
01:38:19,784 --> 01:38:23,550
Unh! Aah!

1205
01:38:23,621 --> 01:38:25,555
It's OK-- aah!

1206
01:38:28,392 --> 01:38:29,552
Unh!

1207
01:38:34,031 --> 01:38:35,123
Aah!

1208
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,827
MUSKA:
It's around here somewhere.

1209
01:38:46,043 --> 01:38:47,135
MUSKA: Hmm.

1210
01:38:51,081 --> 01:38:53,709
MUSKA:
It should be here. Wait!

1211
01:38:54,885 --> 01:38:56,216
This is it!

1212
01:39:04,562 --> 01:39:06,826
- Huh?
- Unh!

1213
01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:08,228
It's the boy!

1214
01:39:08,299 --> 01:39:10,494
- Aah!
- Aah!

1215
01:39:11,936 --> 01:39:14,564
- Sheeta!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

1216
01:39:16,173 --> 01:39:19,404
Well, well, looks like
we caught a little princess.

1217
01:39:19,477 --> 01:39:21,843
Don't hurt her!

1218
01:39:21,912 --> 01:39:24,403
- Unh!
- It came from over here!

1219
01:39:24,482 --> 01:39:27,940
- Colonel, what's happening?
- We've found another pirate.

1220
01:39:28,018 --> 01:39:30,282
And there's one more
hiding under your feet.

1221
01:39:30,354 --> 01:39:32,549
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir! We'll get him.

1222
01:39:35,259 --> 01:39:37,193
Sheeta, I'll find you!

1223
01:39:37,261 --> 01:39:39,889
SHEETA: Pazu!

1224
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:41,397
Huh?

1225
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:45,735
Is that Pazu?

1226
01:39:45,803 --> 01:39:46,929
Uhh!

1227
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:51,806
- Holy smokes!
- Eww.

1228
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:53,776
That wasn't me!

1229
01:39:58,282 --> 01:40:01,718
- I need the commanding officer!
- That way!

1230
01:40:01,785 --> 01:40:03,582
The general's waiting
over there.

1231
01:40:03,654 --> 01:40:05,212
Guards, on the double! Now!

1232
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:06,756
SOLDIER:
You men, come with me!

1233
01:40:06,824 --> 01:40:07,916
- Right away, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1234
01:40:07,992 --> 01:40:10,017
- Dola.
- Huh?

1235
01:40:10,094 --> 01:40:11,220
Hmm?

1236
01:40:13,297 --> 01:40:14,594
Hi there.

1237
01:40:14,665 --> 01:40:17,395
Sheeta's been captured.
I'm going to save her.

1238
01:40:17,468 --> 01:40:20,232
When I cut your ropes.
make a run for it.

1239
01:40:28,212 --> 01:40:30,476
Good luck, now, captain.

1240
01:40:30,548 --> 01:40:32,243
Wait a minute, boy.

1241
01:40:32,316 --> 01:40:34,648
You'd better take this.

1242
01:40:35,686 --> 01:40:38,519
Huh? Uhh-- thank you.

1243
01:40:41,058 --> 01:40:43,993
The boy has become a man.

1244
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:48,225
What? What do you mean, Muska's
destroyed all the radios?

1245
01:40:48,299 --> 01:40:51,860
Sir! He must've done it while
most of the men were outside.

1246
01:40:51,936 --> 01:40:54,427
Several of the guards
have been seriously injured.

1247
01:40:54,505 --> 01:40:57,133
We've spotted Muska heading
for the black dome below, sir.

1248
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:59,732
He's not alone. He's got
those other two men with him.

1249
01:40:59,810 --> 01:41:02,904
So, Colonel Muska reveals
his true nature at last.

1250
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:05,141
Now find him and arrest him!

1251
01:41:05,215 --> 01:41:06,910
All right, first platoon, move!

1252
01:41:06,984 --> 01:41:08,144
Second platoon, fall in!

1253
01:41:08,218 --> 01:41:10,982
You are to shoot
anyone who resists!

1254
01:41:11,055 --> 01:41:13,523
We must find Colonel Muska now!

1255
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:36,910
Uh, excuse me, Colonel Muska.
Where are we?

1256
01:41:36,981 --> 01:41:38,881
We are in the center of Laputa.

1257
01:41:38,949 --> 01:41:40,883
The castle above us
means nothing!

1258
01:41:40,951 --> 01:41:43,249
All of Laputa's
scientific knowledge...

1259
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,880
is contained in this chamber.

1260
01:41:50,761 --> 01:41:52,786
You may wait here, gentlemen.

1261
01:41:52,863 --> 01:41:54,387
- Colonel, please!

1262
01:41:54,465 --> 01:41:56,092
This is a sacred place...

1263
01:41:56,166 --> 01:41:58,396
where only royalty
is allowed to enter.

1264
01:42:00,437 --> 01:42:03,406
Huh? What's happened here? Uhh!

1265
01:42:03,474 --> 01:42:06,637
These filthy roots
don't belong in this chamber!

1266
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:13,379
Horrible things.
I'll have them burned.

1267
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,917
This way. Come!

1268
01:42:27,865 --> 01:42:30,595
There it is! This is it.

1269
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:32,397
See?

1270
01:42:38,175 --> 01:42:41,542
MUSKA: Not here, too! Aah!

1271
01:42:43,714 --> 01:42:45,147
Roots?

1272
01:42:55,659 --> 01:42:58,287
At last!
At last I have found it!

1273
01:43:00,164 --> 01:43:02,826
The largest
aetherium crystal ever.

1274
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:06,495
And the source
of all the power in Laputa.

1275
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:08,868
The amazing thing
is this beautiful stone...

1276
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:11,840
has been awaiting the return
of its king for 700 years.

1277
01:43:11,909 --> 01:43:13,308
SHEETA:
Seven hundred years?

1278
01:43:13,377 --> 01:43:18,110
700 years is a long time
to be without a king, isn't it?

1279
01:43:21,185 --> 01:43:24,313
It's the black stone,
just as the legend says.

1280
01:43:30,194 --> 01:43:32,128
Get away!

1281
01:43:33,964 --> 01:43:36,125
There it is. It's the same.

1282
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:39,132
Who are you, Muska?

1283
01:43:40,437 --> 01:43:45,397
Yes, my dear.
I, too, have an old secret name.

1284
01:43:45,476 --> 01:43:48,639
My real name is
Romska Polo Ul Laputa.

1285
01:43:51,215 --> 01:43:54,343
You and I
have the same royal ancestors.

1286
01:43:54,418 --> 01:43:56,147
We are both of noble blood.

1287
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:58,484
But then our ancestors
left Laputa to live on earth.

1288
01:43:58,555 --> 01:43:59,647
What a mistake!

1289
01:44:09,233 --> 01:44:12,794
- The explosives have no effect!
- This is no ordinary stone!

1290
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:14,770
Then use all of the dynamite
we have!

1291
01:44:14,838 --> 01:44:16,931
MUSKA: General.
there is no need to do that.

1292
01:44:17,007 --> 01:44:18,736
You may come in.

1293
01:44:18,809 --> 01:44:20,299
Where are you, Muska?

1294
01:44:27,885 --> 01:44:29,819
- Aah!
- Aah!

1295
01:44:29,887 --> 01:44:32,082
Huh?

1296
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:37,093
Unh!

1297
01:44:39,897 --> 01:44:42,331
Aaaah!

1298
01:44:44,902 --> 01:44:46,733
Unh!

1299
01:44:55,245 --> 01:44:57,736
Huh? Aah!

1300
01:45:13,764 --> 01:45:15,356
MUSKA:
Really, I don't understand...

1301
01:45:15,432 --> 01:45:19,198
why you hesitate, general.
Please come in.

1302
01:45:19,269 --> 01:45:21,635
Blast him!
All right, follow me!

1303
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,142
Huh?

1304
01:45:34,218 --> 01:45:36,277
After him, men! Hurry!

1305
01:45:36,353 --> 01:45:38,844
Wait, wait, hold on!
Wait a second.

1306
01:45:38,922 --> 01:45:40,981
Just where are you, Muska?

1307
01:45:41,058 --> 01:45:43,390
MUSKA: Please be quiet.

1308
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:44,950
- What?
- Up there!

1309
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:49,394
- Whoa.
- What's going on?

1310
01:45:51,368 --> 01:45:53,097
Hold your tongue, commoner!

1311
01:45:53,170 --> 01:45:55,798
You are in the presence
of the king of Laputa!

1312
01:45:55,873 --> 01:45:57,807
The man has gone crazy!

1313
01:45:57,875 --> 01:46:00,776
I thought I would show you
an example of Laputa's power.

1314
01:46:00,844 --> 01:46:02,573
We are about to celebrate
the rebirth...

1315
01:46:02,646 --> 01:46:04,079
of the Laputian kingdom.

1316
01:46:04,147 --> 01:46:05,580
Sheeta?

1317
01:46:05,649 --> 01:46:09,585
MUSKA: Prepare yourself
for the thunder of Laputa!

1318
01:46:09,653 --> 01:46:12,588
Sheeta, I'm coming.
Aah!

1319
01:46:32,876 --> 01:46:35,344
The fire of heaven
that destroyed...

1320
01:46:35,412 --> 01:46:37,812
Sodom and Gomorrah
in the Old Testament.

1321
01:46:37,881 --> 01:46:41,817
The Rahmaniya referred to it
as Indra's Arrow.

1322
01:46:41,885 --> 01:46:43,876
The entire world
will once again kneel...

1323
01:46:43,954 --> 01:46:46,047
before the power of Laputa.

1324
01:46:46,123 --> 01:46:50,617
I can only say well-done, Muska.
You're a credit to our country.

1325
01:46:50,694 --> 01:46:53,026
As such,
you deserve this reward.

1326
01:46:56,266 --> 01:46:59,064
Huh?

1327
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:03,072
I have really had enough
of your incredible stupidity.

1328
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,768
Aah!

1329
01:47:05,842 --> 01:47:07,833
- Run, everyone!
- You little brat!

1330
01:47:07,911 --> 01:47:09,344
Good-bye!

1331
01:47:36,473 --> 01:47:37,565
Blimey! More robots!

1332
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:38,869
Yeah, and there's a lot of them.

1333
01:47:38,942 --> 01:47:41,410
Make a run for it!

1334
01:47:44,982 --> 01:47:47,780
- Check the flapters!
- OK, mom!

1335
01:47:47,851 --> 01:47:50,046
They're ready to travel!

1336
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,246
LOUIE: Time to go, mama!

1337
01:47:51,321 --> 01:47:55,052
Hush up!
They don't know we're here!

1338
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:04,466
Tarnation.
Now, where are Pazu and Sheeta?

1339
01:48:04,534 --> 01:48:05,967
Can't leave without 'em.

1340
01:48:06,036 --> 01:48:07,401
Oh!

1341
01:48:07,471 --> 01:48:10,736
You had better be gracious
to the new king, dear.

1342
01:48:10,807 --> 01:48:12,570
Ohh!

1343
01:48:12,642 --> 01:48:16,237
You and I will be spending
quite a lot of time together.

1344
01:48:18,615 --> 01:48:20,810
Look at the fools.

1345
01:48:20,884 --> 01:48:23,819
Unbelievably stupid!

1346
01:48:23,887 --> 01:48:26,321
Pathetic.

1347
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:30,326
They simply don't understand.
It is useless to fight me.

1348
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:50,038
Aah! Uhh!

1349
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:51,978
Aah! Ah!

1350
01:48:53,450 --> 01:48:54,974
Huh?

1351
01:48:57,888 --> 01:48:59,515
Robots!

1352
01:49:02,092 --> 01:49:04,925
Aah!

1353
01:49:35,926 --> 01:49:37,860
Sheeta!

1354
01:49:41,932 --> 01:49:45,868
MUSKA: A superior being such as
myself has only one option--

1355
01:49:45,936 --> 01:49:47,767
burn them.

1356
01:49:47,838 --> 01:49:51,035
Don't you agree,
Princess Lusheeta?

1357
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:56,435
MUSKA: Ha ha ha ha ha!

1358
01:49:56,513 --> 01:50:00,005
- You insolent little brat!

1359
01:50:00,083 --> 01:50:01,277
Uhh!

1360
01:50:04,921 --> 01:50:06,786
Seize her!

1361
01:50:06,857 --> 01:50:08,154
Ahh.

1362
01:50:11,962 --> 01:50:15,227
Be a good girl
and give the crystal back.

1363
01:50:15,298 --> 01:50:19,564
Please open up! Please!

1364
01:50:19,636 --> 01:50:21,297
Uhh!

1365
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:28,168
Sheeta, listen to me.
Be reasonable.

1366
01:50:28,245 --> 01:50:31,078
There's no way you can escape.

1367
01:50:31,148 --> 01:50:32,775
SHEETA: Please open! Help me!

1368
01:50:41,758 --> 01:50:43,089
Ah!

1369
01:50:51,635 --> 01:50:53,796
Sheeta!

1370
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,772
Aah!

1371
01:51:07,817 --> 01:51:09,876
PAZU: Sheeta!

1372
01:51:09,953 --> 01:51:13,252
Pazu? Where are you?

1373
01:51:13,323 --> 01:51:16,019
PAZU:
Sheeta! Over here!

1374
01:51:19,496 --> 01:51:21,623
Sheeta!

1375
01:51:21,698 --> 01:51:23,632
- You're alive!
- Stand back.

1376
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:25,759
I'm gonna blast through.

1377
01:51:25,835 --> 01:51:28,770
- Here we go!
- No, Pazu! Hurry! Take this!

1378
01:51:28,838 --> 01:51:31,068
Muska's coming! Hurry!

1379
01:51:35,478 --> 01:51:37,810
SHEETA: Here, take it!

1380
01:51:40,884 --> 01:51:42,818
Throw it into the ocean!

1381
01:51:42,886 --> 01:51:44,012
Uhh!

1382
01:51:45,355 --> 01:51:47,289
Aah!

1383
01:51:47,357 --> 01:51:50,053
Better protect that crystal if
you want to see the girl alive.

1384
01:51:50,126 --> 01:51:52,026
Do you hear me?!

1385
01:52:17,854 --> 01:52:19,685
Aah!

1386
01:52:19,756 --> 01:52:23,214
Get up, princess.
The game is over.

1387
01:52:29,566 --> 01:52:32,967
How appropriate that we've
ended up in the throne room.

1388
01:52:33,036 --> 01:52:34,503
Now get over here.

1389
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:36,436
This is no longer a throne room.

1390
01:52:36,506 --> 01:52:38,997
This is a tomb
for the both of us.

1391
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:42,278
You see, a king
without compassion...

1392
01:52:42,345 --> 01:52:44,074
does not deserve a kingdom.

1393
01:52:44,147 --> 01:52:46,240
You will never
possess the crystal.

1394
01:52:46,316 --> 01:52:50,047
You and I
will die here together.

1395
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:53,749
Now I understand why
the people of Laputa vanished.

1396
01:52:53,823 --> 01:52:56,087
There is a song from my home
in the Valley of Gondoa...

1397
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,558
that explains everything.

1398
01:52:57,627 --> 01:53:00,391
It says,
"Take root in the ground...

1399
01:53:00,463 --> 01:53:02,294
"live in harmony
with the wind...

1400
01:53:02,365 --> 01:53:04,196
"plant your seeds
in the winter...

1401
01:53:04,267 --> 01:53:07,065
"and rejoice with the birds
in the coming of spring."

1402
01:53:07,137 --> 01:53:09,264
No matter how many weapons
you have...

1403
01:53:09,339 --> 01:53:12,467
no matter how great
your technology might be...

1404
01:53:12,542 --> 01:53:14,874
the world cannot live
without love.

1405
01:53:19,082 --> 01:53:22,518
Laputa will live.
I will return it to life.

1406
01:53:22,585 --> 01:53:26,180
Laputa's power
is the dream of all mankind.

1407
01:53:27,691 --> 01:53:30,159
Your ears are next...

1408
01:53:30,226 --> 01:53:33,286
unless you get on your knees
and obey me.

1409
01:53:33,363 --> 01:53:35,831
I command you.
Give me that stone!

1410
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:38,527
PAZU:
Stop right there, Muska!

1411
01:53:38,601 --> 01:53:40,193
I've hidden the stone!

1412
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:41,669
If you do anything
to harm Sheeta...

1413
01:53:41,738 --> 01:53:43,069
you'll never get it back!

1414
01:53:43,139 --> 01:53:44,800
No, Pazu! Listen!

1415
01:53:44,874 --> 01:53:47,809
Run away before he kills you
as well as me!

1416
01:53:47,877 --> 01:53:49,105
Look who's here.

1417
01:53:49,179 --> 01:53:51,147
Why don't you give me the stone,
and the girl will live.

1418
01:53:51,214 --> 01:53:52,374
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

1419
01:53:52,449 --> 01:53:55,282
Are you planning
on fighting me?

1420
01:53:55,352 --> 01:53:58,810
Go ahead. Use that cannon
you can hardly lift.

1421
01:53:58,888 --> 01:54:01,721
You can have the stone
if you let me talk to Sheeta.

1422
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:04,453
No, Pazu! Get out of here
and throw the crystal away!

1423
01:54:04,527 --> 01:54:07,928
I'll give you one minute,
starting now.

1424
01:54:24,013 --> 01:54:26,777
Ohh, Pazu!

1425
01:54:29,352 --> 01:54:32,583
Sheeta,
listen to me very carefully.

1426
01:54:32,655 --> 01:54:34,646
Whisper the spell to me.

1427
01:54:36,393 --> 01:54:38,293
I'll say it with you.

1428
01:54:38,361 --> 01:54:41,296
Just put your hand in mine
and trust me.

1429
01:54:50,874 --> 01:54:53,308
Dola and the boys are free.
Don't worry about them.

1430
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,114
Time's up. What is your answer?

1431
01:55:07,624 --> 01:55:09,353
Huh?

1432
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:13,021
- Balus.
- Balus.

1433
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:17,995
- Aah!
- Aah!

1434
01:55:18,067 --> 01:55:20,501
Aaah!

1435
01:55:41,658 --> 01:55:44,525
Aah! My eyes!

1436
01:55:44,594 --> 01:55:47,256
I can't see!

1437
01:55:53,570 --> 01:55:56,937
No! No!

1438
01:56:06,616 --> 01:56:08,743
We can't wait anymore, mom!

1439
01:56:08,818 --> 01:56:11,048
All right, then.
Let's shove off!

1440
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Hurry Up!

1441
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,500
Look at that!
The whole thing's collapsing!


1442
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,000
Poor kids, I'll really miss them.

1443
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:22,500
They used the spell of destruction.

1444
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
They saved Laputa from
the evil hands of Muska.

1445
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:40,300
Mother look!
What is that big blue light up there?

1446
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:42,600
It's a big stone

1447
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,400
That tree is getting away with our treasure.

1448
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:56,000
Get it! Get it! Move!
Come on you stupid little weirdos!

1449
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,800
Sheeta?

1450
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,300
Pazu!

1451
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:41,400
Looks like these roots saved us.

1452
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,400
It looks fine, it should work.

1453
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,200
Ready?

1454
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:01,900
Ready!

1455
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:03,300
Now!

1456
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,500
What's going on here?
It's getting away from us.

1457
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,000
Sheeta! Yeah!

1458
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:31,500
Dola!

1459
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,800
Thank goodness you're alive.

1460
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So are you! This is great.

1461
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:41,000
No it's not!
My poor little ship is gone forever.

1462
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:45,000
Stop it a-cryin' you big baby!
I'll get you another ship.

1463
02:00:46,700 --> 02:00:51,000
Oh poor little thing,
Nothing worse than having your pigtail shove off.

1464
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:52,600
What have you got under there?

1465
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:56,800
Oh my fault,
You must have hurt yourself on these.

1466
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,500
Now how'd they get inside my blouse?

1467
02:01:01,900 --> 02:01:03,900
All good pirates listen to their mom.
