2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,387
Do you ever look
at someone and wonder...

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,639
"What is going on inside their head?"

4
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,354
Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.

5
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,898
And there she was...

6
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,444
Hello.

7
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,568
Riley.

8
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,493
Look at you.
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

9
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,555
Aren't you a little bundle of Joy?

10
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,566
It was amazing.
Just Riley and me. Forever.

11
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,414
Er, for 33 seconds?

12
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,371
I'm sadness.

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,166
Hello. I... I'm Joy. So...

14
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:53,634
Can I just... if you could...
I just want to fix that. Thanks.

15
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,133
And that was just the beginning.

16
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,098
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

17
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,023
Very nice. Okay, looks like
you got this. Very good.

18
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,941
Sharp turn! No! Look out! No!

19
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,309
That's fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

20
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,818
Easy, easy. We're good. We're good.

21
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,569
- Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

22
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,702
And we're back!

23
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,038
Here we go. All right, open.

24
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
- This looks new.
- You think it's safe?

25
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,715
What is it?

26
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,038
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell, people.

27
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,126
Hold on. What is that?

28
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,209
This is disgust.

29
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,805
She basically keeps
Riley from being poisoned.

30
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,221
Physically and socially.

31
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,299
That is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur.

32
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,434
Hold on, guys.

33
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,758
It's broccoli!

34
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,973
Yucky!

35
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,481
Well, I just saved our lives.
Yeah. You're welcome.

36
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,479
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not gonna get any dessert.

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,860
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

38
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,069
That's anger.

39
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,239
He cares very deeply
about things being fair.

40
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,069
So that's how you want to play it,
old man? No dessert?

41
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:02,625
Sure, we'll eat our dinner!
Right after you eat this!

42
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,920
Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane!

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,086
Airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

44
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,379
Airplane.

45
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,676
And you've met sadness.
She... well, she...

46
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,061
I'm not actually sure what she does.

47
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,567
And I've checked,
there's no place for her to go, so...

48
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,690
She's good, we're good. It's all great!

49
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,738
Anyway, these are Riley's memories

50
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,951
and they're mostly happy,
you'll notice. Not to brag.

51
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,583
But the really important ones
are over here.

52
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,963
I don't want to get too technical,
but these are called core memories.

53
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,174
Each one came from
a super important time in Riley's life.

54
00:04:57,214 --> 00:05:00,554
Like when she first scored a goal.
That was so amazing!

55
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,224
Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!

56
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,943
- We got a future center here!
- Nice job.

57
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,781
And each core memory

58
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:21,741
powers a different aspect
of Riley's personality.

59
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,070
Like hockey island.

60
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,076
Goofball island is my personal favorite.

61
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,214
Come back here, you little monkey!

62
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,791
You're silly.

63
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,166
Yep, goofball is the best.

64
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,093
Friendship island is pretty good too.

65
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:44,343
I love honesty island.
And that's the truth!

66
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,057
And of course,
family island is amazing.

67
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,689
The point is, the islands of personality
are what make Riley... Riley!

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
Look out, mermaid!

69
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,607
Lava!

70
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,949
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong!

71
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,413
- Hey! Very nice!
- Where'd you learn that?

72
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,668
Brain freeze!

73
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,468
Yeah!

74
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,557
- Good night, kiddo.
- Good night, dad.

75
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,268
And... We're out!

76
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:43,107
That's what I'm talking about!
Another perfect day!

77
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,363
Nice job, everybody!

78
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,126
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

79
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,170
All right, we did not die today!
I call that an unqualified success.

80
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,389
And that's it. We love our girl.

81
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,685
She's got great friends
and a great house.

82
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,597
Things couldn't be better.

83
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:21,438
After all, Riley's 11 now.
What could happen?

84
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,900
Sold

85
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,195
what...

86
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,081
Okay, not what I had in mind.

87
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,727
Inside out

88
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,847
hey, look! The golden gate bridge!
Isn't that great?

89
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:01,266
It's not made out of
solid gold like we thought,

90
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,196
which is kind of
a disappointment, but still...

91
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,362
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

92
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,112
Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!

93
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,614
Yeah...

94
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,237
- Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
- For Pete's sake! Move it!

95
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,454
These are my kind of people.

96
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,286
All right, just a few more blocks.
We're almost to our new house!

97
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,422
Step on it, daddy!

98
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,138
Why don't we just
live in this smelly car?

99
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,707
We've already been in it forever.

100
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,502
Which, actually, was really lucky,

101
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,207
because that gave us
plenty of time to think about

102
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,505
what our new house
is going to look like!

103
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,011
What! Let's review
the top five daydreams.

104
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,803
- That looks safe!
- That one's nice.

105
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,347
This will be great for Riley!
No, no, no, no, this one!

106
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,681
Joy, for the last time,
she cannot live in a cookie.

107
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,057
That's the one! It comes with a dragon.

108
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,152
Now we're getting close, I can feel it.

109
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,935
Here it is, here's our new house. And...

110
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,453
Maybe it's nice on the inside.

111
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,961
- We're supposed to live here?
- Do we have to?

112
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,923
I'm telling you, it smells like
something died in here.

113
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,132
Can you die from moving?

114
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,511
Guys, you're overreacting.
Nobody is dying...

115
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,590
A dead mouse!

116
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,430
- Great. This is just great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

117
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,468
It's the house of the dead!
We're going to get rabies!

118
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,682
Get off of me!

119
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,427
Hey. All through the drive,

120
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,483
dad talked about
how cool our new room is.

121
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,559
Let's go check it out!

122
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,693
- Let's go!
- It's gonna be great!

123
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:21,809
Yes, yes, yes.

124
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:22,984
No, no, no, no, no.

125
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,483
I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

126
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,573
Get out the rubber ball,
we're in solitary confinement.

127
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,900
Riley can't live here.

128
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,075
- She's right.
- It's the worst.

129
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,452
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

130
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,157
It's the worst place
I've ever been in my entire life.

131
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,828
Hey, it's nothing
our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

132
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,158
I read somewhere
that an empty room is an opportunity.

133
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,203
Where did you read that?

134
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,618
It doesn't matter.
I read it and it's great.

135
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,044
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

136
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,505
- The hockey lamp goes there.
- Put the chair there.

137
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,844
- The trophy collection goes there.
- Stars! I like that!

138
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,512
Now we're talking! Let's go
get our stuff from the moving Van!

139
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,299
All right. Goodbye.

140
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,263
Well, guess what? The moving Van
won't be here until Thursday.

141
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,756
You're kidding.

142
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,308
The Van is lost? It is the worst day ever!

143
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,100
That figures. The Van is lost.

144
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,646
You said it would be here yesterday!

145
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,267
I know that's what I said.
That's what they told me!

146
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,555
Mom and dad are stressed out!

147
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,608
- They're stressed out?
- What are we going to do?

148
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,691
I've got a great idea!

149
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,238
Did you even read the contract?

150
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,782
Andersen makes her move.
She's closing in!

151
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:16,986
Hey!

152
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,124
No, you're not!

153
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,202
She's lining up for the shot!

154
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,374
Coming behind you.

155
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,752
- Watch out! Watch out!
- She shoots and she scores! Yeah!

156
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,040
Come on, grandma!

157
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,125
"Grandma"?

158
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,012
She put her hair up, we're in for it!

159
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,552
Hey, put me down!

160
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,101
Sorry. Hold on. Hold on.

161
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,429
Hello?

162
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:42,557
Wait. Wh...

163
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,731
You're kidding.

164
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,363
All right. Stall for me.
I'll be right there.

165
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,861
The investor's supposed to show up
on Thursday, not today!

166
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,571
- I got to go.
- It's okay. We get it.

167
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,074
You're the best. Thanks, hon.

168
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,873
See you, sweetie.

169
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,243
Dad just left us.

170
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:04,213
He doesn't love us anymore. That's sad.
I should drive, right?

171
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,378
Joy? What are you doing?

172
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,127
Just give me one second.

173
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:13,632
You know what I've realized?
Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?

174
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,553
Hey, I saw a pizza place
down the street.

175
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,675
Maybe we could try that?

176
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,143
Pizza sounds delicious.

177
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,853
- Pizza? That's good.
- Yes! Pizza!

178
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,602
- What the heck is that?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

179
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,266
That's it. I'm done.

180
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,364
Congratulations, San Francisco,
you've ruined pizza!

181
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,782
First the Hawaiians and now you!

182
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,034
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

183
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,326
Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?

184
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,700
Still, it's not as bad as that soup.
At that diner in Nebraska.

185
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,788
Yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself!

186
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,963
That was disgusting.

187
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,502
Good. Family is running.

188
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:51,796
Dad's got a steel stomach.

189
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,917
The drive out was pretty fun, huh?
What was your favorite part?

190
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,685
Spitting out the car window!

191
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,128
Definitely not when dad was singing.

192
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,218
Wearing a seat belt!

193
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,513
What about the time with the dinosaur?

194
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:02,797
- That's the one.
- Definitely!

195
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,348
Say cheese!

196
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,933
- Dad! Dad!
- Honey!

197
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,556
- Now hold still.
- The car!

198
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,814
Stop! No, no, no!

199
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,022
Nice one, Joy.

200
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,778
I liked that time at the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

201
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,163
Wait. What? What happened?

202
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,368
She did something to the memory.

203
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,383
What did you do?

204
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,629
I just touched it.

205
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,548
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Change it back, Joy!

206
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,009
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

207
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,047
- No! I guess I can't!
- Good going, sadness.

208
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:40,512
Now when Riley thinks of that moment
with dad, she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

209
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:45,102
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know...
I thought maybe if you...

210
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,478
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

211
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:53,401
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figure out what's going on.

212
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,652
- Okay.
- All right. Get ready.

213
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,362
This is a monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down!

214
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,005
Wait, what? What happened?

215
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,673
- A core memory!
- No!

216
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,003
Sadness, what are you doing?

217
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,416
It looked like one was crooked
so I opened it and then it fell out. I...

218
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,889
It's just that...
I wanted to maybe hold one.

219
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,394
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa.

220
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,521
Sadness, you nearly
touched a core memory.

221
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,985
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

222
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,107
I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

223
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,025
It's like I'm having a breakdown.

224
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,282
You're not having a breakdown.
It's stress.

225
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,986
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

226
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:49,287
- No, you're not.
- And annoying.

227
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:53,251
You know what?
You can't focus on what's going wrong.

228
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,922
There's always a way to
turn things around, to find the fun.

229
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:00,172
Yeah. Find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

230
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:03,257
Okay. Well, try to think
of something funny.

231
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,506
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

232
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,558
Yeah, that's not...

233
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,270
What about that time with Meg

234
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:15,480
when Riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose?

235
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,904
Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.

236
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,202
It was awful.

237
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,949
Okay, okay, don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

238
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,471
What are your favorite things to do?

239
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,487
My favorite?

240
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,536
Well, I like it when we're outside.

241
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,410
That's good.
Like there's the beach and sunshine.

242
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,456
Like that time we buried dad
in the sand up to his neck.

243
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,042
I was thinking more like rain.

244
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,424
Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!

245
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,336
We can stomp around in puddles.

246
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:47,716
You know, there's cool umbrellas,
lightning storms.

247
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,604
More like when the rain runs down
our back and makes our shoes soggy.

248
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:54,692
And we get all cold, shivery,

249
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,650
and everything just
starts feeling droopy.

250
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,821
Hey, hey. Hey, easy.

251
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,610
Why are you crying?

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,160
It's just like really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

253
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,947
Crying helps me slow down and obsess
over the weight of life's problems.

254
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,658
You know what?
Let's, think about something else.

255
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:17,707
How about we read some
mind manuals, huh? Sounds fun.

256
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,253
I've read most of them.

257
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,046
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

258
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,219
"Long term memory retrieval,
volume 47"?

259
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,589
- No.
- A real page-Turner!

260
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:30,507
"Long term memory data selection
via channel subgrouping"?

261
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,176
See? Fun already! You lucky dog.

262
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,897
You're reading these cool things.
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

263
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,623
What can we do? We've only got capital
to last a month, maybe two.

264
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,330
If we can't find investors by then,
we're going to have to lay people off.

265
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,660
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me good night!

266
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,037
- I know. I know.
- Be right there!

267
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,293
We've got to land this, okay?

268
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,669
Did you hear dad?
He sounded really upset.

269
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,933
What was that?
Was it a bear? It's a bear!

270
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,512
There are no bears in San Francisco.

271
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,725
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

272
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,055
I'm so jumpy. My nerves are shot.

273
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,391
I don't want to hear about your nerves.

274
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,477
I'll tell you what it is.

275
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,442
This move has been a bust.

276
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,692
That's what I've been telling you guys!

277
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,402
There are at least 37 things
for Riley to be scared of right now.

278
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,243
The smell alone
is enough to make her gag.

279
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,238
I can't believe
mom and dad moved us here!

280
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,530
Look, I get it. You guys have concerns.

281
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,954
But we've been through worse!

282
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,834
Tell you what,
let's make a list of all the things

283
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,621
Riley should be happy about.

284
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,544
Fine. Let's see, this house stinks,
our room stinks.

285
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,672
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

286
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,421
And all of our stuff is in the missing Van!

287
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,251
Come on. It could be worse.

288
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,166
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on the dirty floor. In a bag.

289
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,305
Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start.
But think of all the good things that...

290
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,096
No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

291
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,390
Let us handle this.

292
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,893
I say we skip school tomorrow
and lock ourselves in the bedroom.

293
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,726
We have no clean clothes.
I mean, no one should see us.

294
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,481
Yeah, we could cry
until we can't breathe.

295
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,114
We should lock the door
and scream that curse word we know.

296
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,070
- It's a good one!
- Now hold on!

297
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,110
Look, we all have our off days.
You know...

298
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,235
Hi, honey.

299
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,371
The mom bad news train is pulling in.
Toot-toot!

300
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,372
Still no moving Van.

301
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,964
Now they're saying it won't be here
till Tuesday, can you believe it?

302
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,078
Toot-toot-toot!

303
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,174
Where's dad?

304
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,381
On the phone. This new venture
is keeping him pretty busy.

305
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,962
I rest my case!

306
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,715
Your dad's a little stressed,

307
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,629
you know, about getting
his new company up and running.

308
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,347
Now for a few
well-placed withering scowls.

309
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,310
I guess all I really want to say is,
thank you.

310
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,312
You know, through all this confusion
you've stayed...

311
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:45,105
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

312
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,985
Your dad's under a lot of pressure,

313
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,486
but if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

314
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,243
We can do that for him. Right?

315
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,158
Well.

316
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,081
Yeah, sure.

317
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,326
What did we do to deserve you?

318
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,132
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

319
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,840
Well, you can't argue with mom.
Happy it is.

320
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,176
Team happy! Sounds great!

321
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,352
Totally behind you, Joy.

322
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,681
Looks like we're going into rem.

323
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,686
I got dream duty, so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

324
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:26,648
Great day today, guys!
Sleep well, team happy!

325
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:30,325
All right, what's on tonight,
dream production?

326
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,026
Well, this is it. The new place.

327
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,621
Come live with me, Riley.

328
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,416
Somebody order a broccoli pizza?

329
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,042
- Eat me!
- I'm organic!

330
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,916
No! Who is in charge
of programing down there?

331
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,968
I know I'm not supposed
to do this, but...

332
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,272
We are not going to
end the day like this.

333
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,648
Don't you worry.

334
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,729
I'm gonna make sure
that tomorrow is another great day.

335
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,605
I promise.

336
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,711
Hello! Did I wake you?

337
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,831
Do you have to play that?

338
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,127
Well, I have to practice.

339
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,800
And I don't think of it as playing
so much as hugging.

340
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,510
Okay, first day of school!
Very, very exciting.

341
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,892
I was up late last night
figuring out a new plan.

342
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,009
Here it is! Fear.

343
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,635
I need a list of all the possible
negative outcomes

344
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,891
on the first day at a new school.

345
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,274
Way ahead of you there. Does anyone
know how to spell "meteor"?

346
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,690
Disgust. Make sure Riley stands out
today. But also blends in.

347
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,611
When I'm through,
Riley will look so good,

348
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,778
the other kids will
look at their own outfits and barf.

349
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:34,897
"Joy." "Yes, Joy?"

350
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,865
"You'll be in charge of the console,
keeping Riley happy all day long.

351
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,606
"And may I add I love your dress?
It's adorable."

352
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,096
"This old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls."

353
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,375
Train of thought! Right on schedule.

354
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,331
Anger. Unload the daydreams.

355
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,536
I ordered extra
in case things get slow in class.

356
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:52,627
It might come in handy.

357
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,959
If this new school is
full of boring, useless classes.

358
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,585
Which it probably will be.

359
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,343
Sadness. I have a
super important job just for you.

360
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,505
- Really?
- Follow me.

361
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,061
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect!

362
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,192
This is the circle of sadness.

363
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:13,649
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

364
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,570
So you want me to just stand here?

365
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,862
Hey, it's not my place
to tell you how to do your job.

366
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:24,407
Just make sure that
all the sadness stays in the circle!

367
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,753
See? You're a pro at this! Isn't this fun?

368
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:28,999
- No.
- Atta girl.

369
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,249
All right, everyone, fresh start.

370
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,382
We are gonna have a good day,
which will turn into a good week,

371
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,629
which will turn into a good year,
which turns into a good life!

372
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,051
So, the big day!
New school, new friends, huh?

373
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,681
I know! I'm kind of nervous,
but I'm mostly excited.

374
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,047
How do I look? Do you like my shirt?

375
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,755
Very cute!

376
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,426
Are you gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

377
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:47,394
Mom and dad? With us in public?

378
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,852
- No thank you.
- I'm on it!

379
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,392
Nope! I'm fine. Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

380
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,838
Have a good day at school, monkey.

381
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,360
Have a great day, sweetheart!

382
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,074
- That's crazy. It really is.
- That was so funny.

383
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,333
Do you know what
basketball game is coming up?

384
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,040
Are you sure we want to do this?

385
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,828
- In we go!
- Okay! Going in! Yes!

386
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:15,877
Did you see her? Hello?

387
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,083
Okay, we've got a group
of cool girls at two o'clock.

388
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,169
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.

389
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,878
Is she wearing eye shadow?

390
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,926
- Yeah, we want to be friends with them.
- Let's go talk to them!

391
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,550
Are you kidding?
We're not talking to them.

392
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:27,927
We want them to like us.

393
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,355
Yeah. Wait, what?

394
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:31,353
Almost finished
with the potential disasters.

395
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:34,905
Worst scenario is either quicksand,
spontaneous combustion,

396
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,318
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of those happen...

397
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,780
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

398
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:44,111
Are you kidding me? Out of the gate?
This is not happening!

399
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:47,078
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

400
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,407
No! Pretend we can't speak English.

401
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,583
Don't worry. I got this.

402
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:53,713
Okay.

403
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,330
My name is Riley andersen.

404
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,587
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

405
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,219
And how about Minnesota?

406
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,700
Can you tell us something about it?

407
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,800
Well, you certainly
get a lot more snow than we do.

408
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,933
She's hilarious!

409
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,102
Yeah, it gets pretty cold.

410
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,604
The lake freezes over,
and that's when we play hockey.

411
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,897
I'm on a great team.
We're called the prairie dogs.

412
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:21,942
My friend Meg plays forward.
And my dad's the coach.

413
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,525
Pretty much everyone
in my family skates.

414
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,453
It's kind of a family tradition.

415
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,200
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

416
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:33,958
Or we did, till I moved away.

417
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,077
- Hey, what gives?
- Wait, what?

418
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:39,375
Hey, sadness! You touched a memory?
We talked about this.

419
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,131
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

420
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,761
Get back in your circle.

421
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,440
- What's going on? Why won't it eject?
- Get it out of there, Joy.

422
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:48,514
We used to play tag and stuff.

423
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,115
Cool kids whispering at three o'clock!

424
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,680
- Did you see that look?
- No.

425
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:52,765
They're judging us!

426
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:56,351
Somebody help me!
Grab that... everybody put...

427
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,436
But everything's different now.
Since we moved.

428
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,030
No! We're crying! At school!

429
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,532
What? Sadness! What are you doing?

430
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,372
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

431
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,615
It's a core memory!

432
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:17,366
But it's blue.

433
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:22,712
No! Wait! Stop it! No! No!

434
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:30,798
Joy, no.

435
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,308
- That's a core memory!
- Hey!

436
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,179
- Joy, wait!
- Stop it! Let go!

437
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,984
The core memories!

438
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:52,242
No, no, no, no!

439
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,717
Thank you, Riley.

440
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:09,257
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place,

441
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:11,803
but we're happy to have you here.

442
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,967
All right, everyone,
get out your history books

443
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,096
and turn to chapter seven.

444
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,193
Can I say that curse word now?

445
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:44,343
No! One, two, three. Okay.

446
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:48,302
I got them. Where are we?

447
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,303
Long term memory? Wait...

448
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,193
Goofball island?

449
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,150
Riley's islands of personality.
They're all down!

450
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,905
This is bad.

451
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,455
We... we can fix this!

452
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:12,317
We just have to get back
to headquarters,

453
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,026
plug the core memories in,
and Riley will be back to normal.

454
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:21,504
Riley has no core memories.
No personality islands and no...

455
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:23,544
What? What is it?

456
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,625
You.

457
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,798
You're not in headquarters.

458
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:29,207
Without you, Riley can't be happy.

459
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,722
We got to get you back up there.

460
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:33,764
I'm coming, Riley.

461
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:52,200
So, as it turns out, the green trash can
is not recycling, it's for Greens.

462
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,859
Like compost. And eggshells.

463
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,696
And the blue one is recycling.
And the black one is trash.

464
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,742
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

465
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:01,197
What do you expect?
All the islands are down.

466
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,366
Joy would know what to do.

467
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,536
That's it.

468
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,422
Until she gets back,
we just do what Joy would do!

469
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:10,882
Great idea. Anger, fear, disgust,
how are we supposed to be happy?

470
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,973
Hey, Riley. I've got good news!

471
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,259
I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Francisco.

472
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:20,315
And get this: Try-outs are tomorrow
after school. What luck, right?

473
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,850
- Hockey?
- What do we do?

474
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,392
Guys, this is...

475
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:24,725
You pretend to be Joy.

476
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,651
Won't it be great
to be back out on the ice?

477
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:30,904
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

478
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,775
What was that?
That wasn't anything like Joy!

479
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,072
- Because I'm not Joy.
- Yeah, no kidding.

480
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,530
Did you guys pick up on that?

481
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,536
- Something's wrong.
- Totally.

482
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,788
Should we ask her?

483
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,671
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

484
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,999
So, how was the first day of school?

485
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:49,255
She's probing us.

486
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,754
I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

487
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,508
What? Okay.

488
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:56,552
It was fine, I guess. I don't know.

489
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:59,353
Very smooth. That was just like Joy.

490
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,559
Something is definitely going on.

491
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:03,978
She's never acted like this before.
What should we do?

492
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,689
We're going to find out
what's happening.

493
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,019
But we'll need support.

494
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,104
Signal the husband.

495
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,284
With a nice pass over to Reeves,
comes across... And nice!

496
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,031
She's looking at us.

497
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,202
- What did she say?
- What?

498
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,747
Sorry, sir. No one was listening.

499
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,168
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

500
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,079
What? What is it, woman? What?

501
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,286
He's making that stupid face again.

502
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,248
I could strangle him right now.

503
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,457
Signal him again.

504
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,891
So, Riley, how was school?

505
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,850
- You got to be kidding me!
- Seriously?

506
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,930
For this we gave up
that Brazilian helicopter pilot?

507
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:47,105
Move! I'll be Joy.

508
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,984
School was great, all right?

509
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,152
Riley. Is everything okay?

510
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,226
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

511
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,938
What is her deal?

512
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,646
All right, make a show of force.

513
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,238
I don't want to have to
put "the foot" down.

514
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:01,243
No, not the foot!

515
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:03,585
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

516
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,200
I'll show you attitude, old man.

517
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,577
No. No, no, no! Stay happy!

518
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:09,714
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

519
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,501
Sir, reporting high levels of sass!

520
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:13,425
Take it to defcon two.

521
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,464
You heard that, gentlemen.
Defcon two.

522
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:20,474
Listen, young lady, I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from...

523
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,351
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

524
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,970
Yeah, well... well...

525
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,305
Here it comes. Prepare the foot!

526
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:30,272
Keys to safety position.

527
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,689
Ready to launch on your command, sir!

528
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,993
Just shut up!

529
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,609
Fire!

530
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:44,487
That's it! Go to your room! Now!

531
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,624
The foot is down! The foot is down!

532
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,625
Good job, gentlemen.
That could have been a disaster.

533
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,709
Well, that was a disaster.

534
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,598
Come fly with me, gatinha.

535
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,736
We're going to walk out there? On that?

536
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,569
It's the quickest way back.

537
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:22,744
But it's right over the memory dump.

538
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,081
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

539
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:29,198
We have to do this for Riley.
Just follow my footsteps.

540
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:33,626
- Okay.
- It's not that high. It's totally fine...

541
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,930
Hey.

542
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,904
So, things got
a little out of hand downstairs.

543
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,768
Do you want to talk about it?

544
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,110
Come on, where's my happy girl?

545
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:02,652
Monkey.

546
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,617
He's trying to start up goofball.

547
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,275
Come on!

548
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,256
Go back! Run, run, run!

549
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,408
What...

550
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,510
I get it. You need some alone time.

551
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:13,766
We'll talk later.

552
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:19,062
We have a Major problem.

553
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:21,151
Joy, where are you?

554
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,902
We lost goofball island.

555
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:29,697
That means she can lose friendship
and hockey and honesty and family.

556
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,373
You can fix this, right, Joy?

557
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,411
I...

558
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,045
I don't know.

559
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,171
But we have to try. Okay, come on.

560
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:41,543
Riley's gone to sleep.

561
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:45,668
Which is a good thing.
When you think about it because

562
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,876
nothing else bad can happen
while she's asleep.

563
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,048
We'll be back to headquarters
before she wakes up.

564
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,677
We'll just go across friendship island.

565
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,478
We'll never make it.

566
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,810
- No!
- No, no, no!

567
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,275
Don't obsess over
the weight of life's problems.

568
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,154
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

569
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,731
Sadness, we don't have time for this.

570
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:07,357
We'll just have to go around.
Take the scenic route.

571
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,784
Wait, Joy, you could get lost in there!

572
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,415
Think positive!

573
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:15,041
Okay. I'm positive
you will get lost in there.

574
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:17,372
That's long term memory.

575
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,964
An endless Warren
of corridors and shelves.

576
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:22,542
I read about it in the manuals.

577
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,586
The manuals? The manuals!

578
00:33:25,631 --> 00:33:27,471
- You read the manuals!
- Yeah.

579
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,679
So you know the way
back to headquarters!

580
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
I guess.

581
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:34,929
You are my map!

582
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,642
Let's go! Lead on, my map!
Show me where we're going!

583
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:42,437
Okay. Only I'm too sad to walk.

584
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:45,533
Just give me a few... Hours.

585
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:48,239
Which way? Left?

586
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,398
Right.

587
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:53,448
No. I mean, go left.
I said left was right. Like "correct."

588
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:54,662
Okay.

589
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,873
This actually feels kind of nice.

590
00:33:56,954 --> 00:34:00,294
Okay, here we go! We'll be back
to headquarters before morning.

591
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:03,964
We can do it! This will be easy!
This is working!

592
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,264
This is not working.
Are we getting close?

593
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,800
Yeah, just another right.

594
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:17,389
And... A left and then another...
Left and...

595
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,854
Are you sure
you know where we're going?

596
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,695
Because we seem to be
walking away from headquarters.

597
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,364
Riley's awake.

598
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:33,568
Don't touch. Remember?
If you touch them, they stay sad.

599
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:37,157
Sorry, I won't. Starting now.

600
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,502
I can't take much more of this.

601
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,120
Forget them!

602
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,674
- Mind workers!
- But, Joy, we're almost...

603
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:47,667
Phone numbers. We don't need
all these. They're in her phone.

604
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:50,194
- Excuse me, hi.
- Just forget all of that. Please. Forget it!

605
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,931
- I need to find friendship island.
- Look at this.

606
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,470
Four years of piano lessons.

607
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:55,761
Yeah, it looks pretty faded.

608
00:34:55,846 --> 00:34:58,716
You know what? Save chopsticks
and heart and soul, get rid of the rest.

609
00:34:59,308 --> 00:35:00,928
- Are you...
- U.S. presidents. What do you think?

610
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,188
Yeah, just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

611
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,480
- Forget 'em!
- Hey! You can't throw those away!

612
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,882
Those are perfectly good memories.

613
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,190
The names of
every "cutie pie Princess" doll?

614
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,356
Yes! That is critical information!
Glitterstorm, honeypants...

615
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,696
Forget 'em!

616
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:19,702
Hey! Bring those back!

617
00:35:19,745 --> 00:35:21,965
They're in the dump.
Nothing comes back from the dump.

618
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,639
Yeah. Look, lady, this is our job, okay?

619
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,077
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

620
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,538
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

621
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:31,376
Yeah, except for this bad boy.
This one will never fade.

622
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,553
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

623
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,954
the song from the gum commercial?

624
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,430
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to headquarters for no reason.

625
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,893
It just plays in Riley's head
over and over again.

626
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,733
Like a million times!

627
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:42,888
Let's watch it again!

628
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,525
Tripledent gum

629
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,561
yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay. Yeah, real catchy. Okay.

630
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:48,766
Hey, what do you think?
Should we do it?

631
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:49,857
Yeah!

632
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
Okay, here we go!

633
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,661
Tripledent gum

634
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,409
what the... this again?

635
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,082
Wait! Do you know
how to get to friendship island?

636
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,411
Tripledent gum

637
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:05,706
do you like it there? Did you feel
any earthquakes? Is the bridge cool?

638
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,499
Yeah, it's good.
What happened with the playoffs?

639
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:09,585
We won the first game.

640
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,920
Coach says we might actually
go to the finals this year.

641
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,884
And we've got this new girl
on the team. She's so cool.

642
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,435
She did not just say that.

643
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,300
A new girl?
Meg has a new friend already?

644
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:20,973
Hey, hey! Stay happy!

645
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,096
We do not want to lose
any more islands here, guys!

646
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,482
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

647
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:26,941
It's like mind reading!

648
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,310
You like to read minds, Meg?

649
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,267
I got something for you to read,
right here!

650
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,675
Let's just be calm for one second!

651
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,108
- I heard they have parrots...
- I've got to go.

652
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,574
- What?
- I got to go!

653
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:41,157
Okay, could you just please
tell me which way is... oh, no!

654
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,755
Friendship island! What?

655
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,340
Not friendship.

656
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,809
Riley loved that one. And now it's gone.

657
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:13,485
Goodbye, friendship. Hello, loneliness.

658
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,825
We'll just have to go the long way.

659
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:25,037
Yeah. The long, long, long, long way.

660
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,326
I'm ready.

661
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,884
There's got to be a better way.

662
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,500
Look at you!

663
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,471
I will take you, but not you.

664
00:37:38,509 --> 00:37:40,549
Who am I kidding? I can't leave you.

665
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,759
Hello!

666
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,056
Wait! Hey! Wait!

667
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,023
Wait! Stop!

668
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:57,817
Excuse me.

669
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,360
I was looking for... diversion!

670
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,318
- What?
- So long, sucker!

671
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,042
I hurt all over.

672
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,909
Wait. I know you.

673
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:11,536
No, you don't. I get that a lot.
I look like a lot of people.

674
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,045
No, no, no. I do.

675
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,845
Bing bong! Riley's imaginary friend!

676
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:18,379
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

677
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,973
Riley loved playing with you!
You two are best friends!

678
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,551
You would know. We're trying
to get back to headquarters.

679
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:25,755
Headquarters?
You guys are from headquarters?

680
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,928
Well, yeah. I'm Joy. This is sadness.

681
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,727
You're Joy? The Joy?

682
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:32,399
What the heck are you doing out here?

683
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,557
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, sadness?

684
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,566
Without you, Riley won't ever be happy.

685
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,071
We can't have that.
We got to get you back.

686
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,112
I'll tell you what. Follow me!

687
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,237
Thank you!

688
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:44,912
It is so great to see you again.

689
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,242
I gotta tell you,
I am such a huge fan of your work.

690
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:50,286
Do you remember
when you and Riley were in a band?

691
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:52,252
I went to all of your concerts.

692
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:53,751
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

693
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,382
Watching you play tag was such a treat.

694
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,749
Two-time world champ.

695
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:58,415
And remember your rockets?

696
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:00,755
Of course! It runs on song power!

697
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,261
That's right! Your theme song!

698
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,762
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

699
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,102
Bing bong bing bong

700
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:06,497
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

701
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,315
- Bing bong, bing bong
- bing bong, bing bong

702
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:10,728
what exactly are you supposed to be?

703
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:13,477
You know, it's unclear.
I'm mostly cotton candy.

704
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:18,272
But shape-wise I'm part cat,
part elephant, part dolphin.

705
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:19,358
Dolphin?

706
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:25,281
You got to remember, when Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

707
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,275
The cow goes moo.
The horse goes neigh.

708
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,946
That's all people
talked about back then.

709
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,576
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's true.
What are you doing out here?

710
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:35,042
Well, there's not much call
for imaginary friends lately.

711
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,585
So I, you know...

712
00:39:39,296 --> 00:39:41,626
Hey, hey. don't be sad.

713
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,795
Tell you what.
When I get back up to headquarters,

714
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:45,844
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

715
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,258
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that.

716
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,849
This is the greatest day of my life!

717
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:56,771
Are you okay?

718
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,281
- Hey, what's going on?
- I cry candy.

719
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,437
Try the caramel. It's delicious.

720
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,111
- Here, use this.
- Thanks!

721
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,196
Hold on, wait a second.

722
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,794
It always gets stuck at the bottom.

723
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,497
Here. What? It's imaginary.

724
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,585
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to headquarters.

725
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,422
Walk? We're not walking.

726
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,587
We're taking the train of thought!

727
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,047
The train, of course!

728
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,677
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

729
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,433
Well, it kind of goes all over the place,

730
00:40:33,517 --> 00:40:35,887
but there is a station
in imagination land.

731
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:38,688
I know a shortcut. Come on, this way!

732
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,900
I am so glad we ran into you!

733
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:44,195
The station is right through here.
After you.

734
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,648
- Joy.
- What?

735
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:48,866
I read about this place in the manual.
We shouldn't go in there.

736
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,407
Bing bong says
it's the quickest way to headquarters.

737
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:53,703
No, but, Joy, this is abstract thought.

738
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:57,325
What are you talking about? I go in here
all the time. It's a shortcut, you see?

739
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:01,174
D-a-n-g-e-r. Shortcut.
I'll prove it to you.

740
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:07,126
Look at me. I'm closer to the station
because I'm taking the shortcut.

741
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:09,388
Let's go around. This way.

742
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,219
Almost there!

743
00:41:12,097 --> 00:41:14,637
If you want to walk the long way,
go for it.

744
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,735
But Riley needs to be happy.

745
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,558
I'm not missing that train.
Bing bong knows what he's doing.

746
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,485
He's part dolphin. They're very smart.

747
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,235
Well, I guess.

748
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,205
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

749
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,417
Okay, what abstract concept
are we trying to comprehend today?

750
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,759
Loneliness.

751
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,431
Looks like there's something in there.

752
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,928
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

753
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,510
What did I tell you?
You'll be at headquarters in no time.

754
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,179
Say, would you look at that?

755
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,942
- What's happening?
- Oh, no, they turned it on.

756
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,900
Never seen this before.

757
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,614
My face! My beautiful face!

758
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:10,784
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

759
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:14,954
There are four stages. This is the first:
Non-objective fragmentation!

760
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,115
All right. Do not panic.

761
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:18,623
What is important
is that we all stay together.

762
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:22,673
We're in the second stage.
We're deconstructing!

763
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:23,751
Run!

764
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,009
I can't feel my legs!

765
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:28,844
There they are.

766
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:30,134
Come here, me!

767
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:35,852
We've got to get out of here before
we're nothing but shape and color!

768
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,471
We'll get stuck here forever!

769
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,306
Stuck? Why did we come in here?

770
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,981
I told you, it's a shortcut!

771
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,610
The train!

772
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,069
Oh, no. We're two-dimensional!
That's stage three!

773
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,164
We're getting nowhere!

774
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:55,277
- Depth! I'm lacking depth!
- Come on.

775
00:42:58,412 --> 00:42:59,662
We can't fit.

776
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:03,576
Oh, no, we're nonfigurative.
This is the last stage!

777
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,417
We're not going to make it!

778
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:10,877
Wait! We're two-dimensional.
Fall on your face!

779
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,647
Stop! Stop!

780
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:28,068
No! I thought you said
that was a shortcut.

781
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,070
I did, but wow,
we should not have gone in there.

782
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,233
That was dangerous!
They really should put up a sign.

783
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:34,363
How long until the next train?

784
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:38,243
Who knows. But don't worry.
There's another station. That way.

785
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:41,407
The train always stops there.
Right before it goes to headquarters.

786
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,456
If we hurry, we can catch it.

787
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,830
This isn't another one
of your shortcuts, is it?

788
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,292
Yeah!

789
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:50,168
Is there really another station?

790
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,384
Through there.

791
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,092
Welcome to imagination land!

792
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:58,426
- Imagination land?
- Sure!

793
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,894
I come here all the time.
I'm practically the mayor.

794
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:03,733
Hey, you guys hungry?
There's French fry forest!

795
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,059
- Delicious.
- No way!

796
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,734
Check it out! Trophy town!

797
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,895
Medals! Ribbons! Everyone's a winner!

798
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,613
I won first place!

799
00:44:14,696 --> 00:44:17,446
- Me too!
- Participation award.

800
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:20,953
Wait, is that...
Sadness, look, it's cloud town!

801
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,036
That is my favorite!

802
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,460
It's so soft!

803
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,250
Let me try.

804
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,133
Hey! What's the big idea?

805
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,920
You better fix that wall,
or else you're in big troub...

806
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,418
Oh, no! Lava!

807
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,836
Imagination land is the best!

808
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,814
Is it all going to be so interactive?

809
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,180
Hey, look! The house of cards!

810
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:46,598
Wait. Hang on just a minute.

811
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,147
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

812
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,940
I stashed it in there for safekeeping,

813
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,443
and now I'm all set to
take Riley to the moon!

814
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,452
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

815
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,609
I love imagination land.

816
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,448
Isn't it great? And there's
always something new, like...

817
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,293
Who the heck is that?

818
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,711
Imaginary boyfriend.

819
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,619
I would die for Riley.

820
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,588
- I've never seen him before.
- I live in Canada.

821
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,800
Anyway, this way.
Through preschool world!

822
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,051
- We're nearly to the train!
- Riley, here we come!

823
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,813
This should be fun!
New team, new friends.

824
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,180
These kids look pretty good,

825
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:25,926
considering they're from San Francisco.

826
00:45:25,976 --> 00:45:27,306
Okay, andersen, you're up!

827
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:30,402
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

828
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,650
Luck isn't going to help us now.

829
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:33,482
If she tries to use hockey island,
it's going down.

830
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,897
Which is why I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

831
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:39,777
One of these has got to work
in place of the core memory.

832
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,243
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

833
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,539
We did it, gang! It's working!

834
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:58,838
Line change! Line change!
Change it up!

835
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:05,022
No! No!

836
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,229
It's like we don't learn anything.

837
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:14,364
- Come on!
- Let's pick it up out there!

838
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,859
Pass! Shoot it! Shoot it!

839
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,859
- That's it!
- No, no, no! Breathe.

840
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:22,116
Find your happy place.

841
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,915
What's her problem?

842
00:46:34,294 --> 00:46:36,254
- Riley. What's wrong?
- Let's go.

843
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,878
- You're not going to finish try-outs?
- What's the point?

844
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:41,224
Hey. It'll be all right.
Let's just go back...

845
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:43,351
Stop saying everything will be all right!

846
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,854
Nice hustle, ladies!

847
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,230
Hockey?

848
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:03,913
No, no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey.

849
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:06,239
- Hey! Look at that! Very nice shot!
- Hey!

850
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,165
Bing bong,
we have to get to that station.

851
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:10,415
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham cracker castle.

852
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,625
Hey. That's weird. Graham cracker
castle used to be right here.

853
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:16,039
I wonder why they moved it?
That's not...

854
00:47:16,086 --> 00:47:18,586
I would have sworn
sparkle pony mountain was right here.

855
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,422
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah, yeah... I don't know...

856
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,467
- We'll have to come back.
- Princess dream world!

857
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,927
Oh, no!
The stuffed animal hall of fame!

858
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:30,516
My rocket!

859
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,435
Wait! Riley and I,
we're still using that rocket!

860
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,020
It still has some song power left!

861
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:37,606
Who's your friend who likes to play?

862
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:47,827
No! No, no, no. No, you can't
take my rocket to the dump!

863
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,270
Riley and I are going to the moon!

864
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,289
Riley can't be done with me.

865
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,047
Hey, it's going to be okay!
We can fix this!

866
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,057
We just need to
get back to headquarters.

867
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:10,469
Which way to the train station?

868
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:13,016
I had a whole trip planned for us.

869
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:18,983
Hey, who's ticklish, huh?
Here comes the tickle monster!

870
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,820
Hey, bing bong! Look at this!

871
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,031
Here's a fun game!

872
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:30,204
You point to the train station
and we all go there!

873
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:33,495
Won't that be fun?
Come on, let's go to the train station!

874
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:36,915
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

875
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,420
They took something that you loved.
It's gone. Forever.

876
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:44,836
Sadness. don't make him feel worse.

877
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:48,185
- Sorry.
- It's all I had left of Riley.

878
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,890
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

879
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:53,142
They were wonderful.

880
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,983
Once we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

881
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,100
Sadness...

882
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:00,818
It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

883
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:05,533
She did. We were best friends.

884
00:49:05,612 --> 00:49:07,912
Yeah. It's sad.

885
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,710
I'm okay now.

886
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:26,012
Come on. The train station is this way.

887
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,064
How did you do that?

888
00:49:34,141 --> 00:49:36,061
I don't know. He was sad.

889
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:37,393
So I listened to what...

890
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,897
Hey! There's the train!

891
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,832
We made it!
We're finally going to get home!

892
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:58,582
Oh, no! These facts and opinions
look so similar.

893
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:01,245
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.

894
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,262
On a scale of one to ten,
I give this day an f.

895
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:11,340
Well, why don't we quit standing around
and do something?

896
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,508
Like what, genius?

897
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,426
Like quitting. That's what I'm doing.

898
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:18,605
Sure it's the coward's way out.
But this coward's gonna survive.

899
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,940
Emotions can't quit, genius!

900
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,860
I thought we were supposed
to be keeping Riley happy.

901
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:33,989
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

902
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,497
- What is it?
- Nothing.

903
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,883
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

904
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,551
All the good core memories
were made in Minnesota.

905
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:49,720
Ergo, we go
back to Minnesota and make more.

906
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
- Ta-da!
- Wait, wait, wait.

907
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:52,804
You're saying we run away?

908
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:54,296
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

909
00:50:54,346 --> 00:50:56,966
I'd call it the happy core
memory development program.

910
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:58,347
You can't be serious.

911
00:50:58,433 --> 00:50:59,853
Hey! Our life was perfect

912
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:03,815
until mom and dad decided
to move to San Fran stinktown.

913
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,195
I mean, it's just so drastic!

914
00:51:06,275 --> 00:51:08,495
Need I remind you
of how great things were there?

915
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,197
Our room? Our back yard? Our friends?

916
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,320
- Tripledent gum
- will make you smile

917
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,658
did I ask for the gum commercial?

918
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,580
Anyway, it was better, that's my point.

919
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:21,162
Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.

920
00:51:21,248 --> 00:51:23,608
Wait. Hold on. Shouldn't we
just sleep on this or something?

921
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,344
Fine. Let's sleep on it.

922
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,297
Because, hey,
I'm sure jolly fun-filled times

923
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:30,718
are just around the corner.

924
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,348
Hey, hey! Why aren't we moving?

925
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:46,766
Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

926
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:48,687
You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

927
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,944
Yeah, the train of thought
doesn't run while she's asleep.

928
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:53,408
- We can't wait that long.
- How about we wake her up?

929
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:56,278
Sadness, that's ridiculous!
How could we possibly...

930
00:51:58,702 --> 00:51:59,742
How about we wake her up?

931
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,368
- Great idea, Joy.
- Thanks. Come on!

932
00:52:02,414 --> 00:52:04,044
Dream productions

933
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,464
this place is huge!

934
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:11,966
Yeah, it looks so much smaller
than I expected.

935
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,639
I can fly? I love that one!

936
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,387
Rainbow unicorn! She's right there!

937
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:25,402
My friend says you're famous.
She wants your autograph.

938
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:28,269
No, no, sadness,
don't bother miss unicorn, okay?

939
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:31,277
Sorry, she's from out of town.
That was so embarrassing, right?

940
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,739
I loved you in
fairy dream adventure part 7.

941
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,411
Okay, bye. I love you!

942
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,660
Do not enter when light flashing

943
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:39,451
wonder what that means.

944
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:40,705
Well, let's go in.

945
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:45,675
Set up the classroom set!
Today's memories are in!

946
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,579
We've got a lot to work with here.

947
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:50,628
Riley dumped her best friend,
had a miserable day at school,

948
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:51,762
and quit hockey.

949
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,007
The writers have
put together a killer script!

950
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:56,261
Just because Joy
and sadness are gone,

951
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:57,891
I have to do stupid dream duty.

952
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,645
Okay. How are we
going to wake her up?

953
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:04,603
Well, she wakes up sometimes
when she has a scary dream.

954
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:05,643
We could scare her.

955
00:53:05,727 --> 00:53:07,977
Scare her? No,
she's been through enough already.

956
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:09,113
- But, Joy...
- Sadness,

957
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:11,647
you may know your way
around down here, but I know Riley.

958
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:15,203
We're gonna make her so happy,
she'll wake up with exhilaration.

959
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:16,569
We'll excite her awake!

960
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:18,703
That's never happened before.

961
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:20,372
Riley loves dogs. Put this on.

962
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,450
I don't think that'll work.

963
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,163
- Bing bong?
- Yeah?

964
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:26,295
- Don't let anything happen to these.
- Got it.

965
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,753
Add the reality distortion filter.

966
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:34,665
Love it. Remember,
play to the camera, everyone!

967
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:36,376
Riley is the camera!

968
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:39,716
Makeup, get out of there,
we are on in five, four, three...

969
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,972
Hello, class.

970
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:47,476
Before we begin today's pop quiz...

971
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:49,311
Man, she is one bad actress.

972
00:53:49,354 --> 00:53:51,194
...which counts for 90%
of your final grade,

973
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:56,355
I want to introduce
our new student. Riley.

974
00:53:56,445 --> 00:53:58,535
Would you like to stand up

975
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:00,284
- and introduce yourself?
- Camera.

976
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,198
And cue Riley.

977
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:04,955
My name is Riley andersen.

978
00:54:04,995 --> 00:54:07,835
I'm from Minnesota and now I live here.

979
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,460
Look! Her teeth are falling out!

980
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,711
- That's disgusting.
- Gross!

981
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:16,335
Teeth falling out.
Yeah, I'm used to that one.

982
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:19,258
Let me guess, we have no pants on.

983
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,343
Hey, look! She came to school
with no pants on!

984
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:22,506
Called it!

985
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:23,554
Ready?

986
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,847
I don't think this happy thing
is going to work. But if we scare her...

987
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,444
Just follow my lead. Here we go.

988
00:54:29,686 --> 00:54:31,856
Bark! Bark! Bark!

989
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:33,019
Who is that?

990
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:34,732
What's going on?

991
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:38,653
Asleep
asleep - awake

992
00:54:41,073 --> 00:54:42,663
you're on! Go!

993
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,411
Let's party! Let's dance!

994
00:54:47,037 --> 00:54:48,157
Hey, a party.

995
00:54:49,706 --> 00:54:50,786
Bark, bark, bark!

996
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,794
Joy, this isn't working.

997
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,270
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here!

998
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,813
It's just a dream, it's just a dream.
It's just a dream.

999
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,138
They're trying to wake her up.
Call security!

1000
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,766
Hi, Riley, it's me!

1001
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,275
- Who's your friend who likes to play?
- Bing bong?

1002
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,936
- Bing bong, bing bong!
- Sadness, stop! It was working!

1003
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,488
Sadness! You are ruining this dream!
You're scaring her!

1004
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:22,952
But look, it's working!

1005
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:26,757
They are not part of this dream.
Get them!

1006
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:28,541
Stop right there!

1007
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:31,661
Pan away! Pan away!

1008
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,249
Pick a plotline!

1009
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:40,007
- Careful!
- Hold still!

1010
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,420
You can't do this!

1011
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,586
I know people in headquarters!

1012
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,723
Cut that out! Please!

1013
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:52,935
Do you like candy? You look hungry.
I get you candy! No!

1014
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:54,768
No, no. No, no!

1015
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:56,937
There go the core memories!

1016
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:59,322
I can't go in there!
I'm scared of the dark! Please!

1017
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:01,744
Come on.

1018
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,780
- What is this place?
- The subconscious.

1019
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:09,786
It's where they take
all the troublemakers.

1020
00:56:12,623 --> 00:56:13,963
My hat feels loose.

1021
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:15,539
How do we get in?

1022
00:56:15,626 --> 00:56:18,086
- Let me see.
- You got my hat? Or is that your hat?

1023
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,212
Yeah, it's my hat.

1024
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:21,336
You sure?
I don't know, look in the label.

1025
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,471
- Yeah, it says, "my hat."
- Wait, it says, "my hat"?

1026
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,300
- My hat, it says.
- That's what I wrote in my hat.

1027
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:27,855
- What are you talking about?
- You've got my hat on.

1028
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,350
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1029
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:31,981
- Hey! You!
- You caught us!

1030
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:35,233
Get back in there! No escaping!

1031
00:56:45,072 --> 00:56:49,332
I don't like it here. It's where
they keep Riley's darkest fears.

1032
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:52,906
It's broccoli.

1033
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:57,289
The stairs to the basement!

1034
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:01,547
Grandma's vacuum cleaner!

1035
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,347
Okay, come on.

1036
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,270
- Would you walk quieter?
- I'm trying.

1037
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:16,686
What is going...

1038
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,810
Candy wrappers?

1039
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:33,124
- Bing bong!
- Joy?

1040
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,203
- There you are.
- Shhh!

1041
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:42,628
It's jangles.

1042
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,092
Who's the birthday girl?
Who's the birthday girl?

1043
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,604
Do you have the core memories?

1044
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:02,267
Yeah. All he cared about was the candy!

1045
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,593
We're out of here! Let's get to that train!

1046
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:26,839
Wait! The train's not running.
We still have to wake up Riley.

1047
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,094
But how?

1048
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:32,183
Oh, no!

1049
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,699
Hey, sadness. Did you hear \about
the pa-pa-party they were having?

1050
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:59,415
Yeah. Yes, Joy. Isn't it a birthday party?

1051
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:01,956
Did you say birthday?

1052
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,543
And there's going to be
cake and presents.

1053
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:05,798
And games and balloons...

1054
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,339
A birthday?

1055
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:09,342
Okay. Follow us!

1056
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:13,094
Nothing like a good scare
to wake you up, right?

1057
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:14,596
Okay, but it's my handwriting.

1058
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,098
No it isn't. That's my... I wrote that.

1059
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:17,499
No, but this one's my handwriting.

1060
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,005
Who's the birthday girl?

1061
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:45,838
Come on, let's go!

1062
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,887
We made it!

1063
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,350
Guess who's on their way
to headquarters!

1064
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:58,471
We are!

1065
01:00:05,397 --> 01:00:08,017
- What is going on?
- He did it again!

1066
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,568
We were at school, and we were naked,
and there was a dog,

1067
01:00:10,652 --> 01:00:14,032
and his back half was chasing him
and then we saw bing bong!

1068
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:17,372
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridiculous!

1069
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:20,159
We can't even get
a good night's sleep anymore.

1070
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,874
Time to take action.

1071
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:23,575
Stupid mom and dad.

1072
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,825
If they hadn't moved us,
none of this would've happened.

1073
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:27,166
Who's with me?

1074
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:30,418
No no no no no.

1075
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:33,131
Yeah. Let's do it.

1076
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:47,275
She took it. There's no turning back.

1077
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,976
So how are we going
to get to Minnesota from here?

1078
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,067
Well, why don't we go down
to the elephant lot

1079
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,242
and rent an elephant?

1080
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,570
Hey. That sounds nice.

1081
01:00:54,613 --> 01:00:56,073
We're taking the bus, nitwit!

1082
01:00:58,283 --> 01:01:00,293
There's a bus
leaving tomorrow. Perfect!

1083
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:02,369
A ticket costs money.
How do we get money?

1084
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,752
- Mom's purse.
- You wouldn't.

1085
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:07,460
But I would.
Where was it we saw it last?

1086
01:01:09,002 --> 01:01:11,002
- Tripledent gum
- no!

1087
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:14,298
It's downstairs somewhere.
Mom and dad got us into this mess.

1088
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:16,091
They can pay to get us out.

1089
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:23,216
How about this, huh? Isn't this nice?
You can see everything from up here.

1090
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:26,477
Look, there's inductive reasoning.
There's déjà vu.

1091
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,312
There's language processing.
There's déjà vu.

1092
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:31,978
There's critical thinking.
There's déjà vu.

1093
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,737
Hey, look at this, guys! Memories!

1094
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:39,784
Hey. That was a good idea.
About scaring Riley awake.

1095
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:41,407
You're not so bad.

1096
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,661
Really?

1097
01:01:43,245 --> 01:01:44,255
Nice work.

1098
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,873
I can't wait to get the old Riley back.

1099
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,748
As soon as we get there,
I'm going to fix this whole mess.

1100
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,094
Is this Riley?

1101
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:54,919
She's so big now.
She won't fit in my rocket.

1102
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,425
How are we gonna get to the moon?

1103
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:59,216
It's that time in the twisty tree,
remember?

1104
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:03,313
The hockey team showed up
and mom and dad were there cheering.

1105
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,060
Look at her, having fun and laughing.

1106
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:08,437
I love this one.

1107
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:10,859
I love that one, too.

1108
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,399
Atta girl! Now you're getting it!

1109
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:17,243
Yeah. It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1110
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:21,621
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful. She wanted to quit.

1111
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:25,833
Sorry. I went sad again, didn't I?

1112
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:30,417
I'll tell you what. We can keep working
on that when we get back. Okay?

1113
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:31,581
Okay.

1114
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:35,459
But I just don't understand.

1115
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,845
Why did our moving Van
even go to Texas?

1116
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,348
Multiple customers?

1117
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,780
Well, we were promised
delivery on the fifth.

1118
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,409
Excuse me,
isn't there any way that you can rush it?

1119
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:16,166
Honesty island?

1120
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:26,143
Look out!

1121
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,730
Come on!

1122
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:38,147
Hold on!

1123
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:42,325
Hurry up! Come on! Over here!
Come on, people! Let's, go, go, go!

1124
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,456
That was our way home.

1125
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:58,588
We lost another island?
What is happening?

1126
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:01,932
Haven't you heard?
Riley's running away.

1127
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,179
What?

1128
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,601
Wait, wait, hang on, guys.

1129
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,773
Are we really doing this?
I mean, this is serious.

1130
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:11,480
Look. We have no core memories.

1131
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,060
You want Riley to be happy?

1132
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,733
Let's get back to Minnesota
and make more.

1133
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:19,981
Joy, if we hurry, we can still stop her.

1134
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:22,898
Family island. Let's go!

1135
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:40,126
Joy! Joy! It's too dangerous!

1136
01:04:40,714 --> 01:04:42,344
We won't make it in time.

1137
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:47,104
But that's our only way back!

1138
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:01,155
A recall tube!

1139
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,910
We can get recalled!

1140
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,662
Have a great day, sweetheart.

1141
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:12,334
See you after school, monkey.

1142
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:13,965
We love you!

1143
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,335
Go! Run, run! Go!

1144
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:33,024
Whoa! Whoa! Sadness! Sadness, stop!

1145
01:05:34,059 --> 01:05:35,389
You're hurting Riley!

1146
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,267
No, no, no! I did it again!

1147
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:41,483
If you get in here,
these core memories will get sad.

1148
01:05:46,989 --> 01:05:50,079
I'm sorry. Riley needs to be happy.

1149
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:51,868
Joy?

1150
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:06,929
Joy!

1151
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,808
Joy!

1152
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:46,420
Joy?

1153
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:54,602
Joy!

1154
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:03,689
Joy, what are you doing?
Will you stop it, please?

1155
01:07:07,945 --> 01:07:11,745
Don't you get it, Joy?
We're stuck down here.

1156
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,122
We're forgotten.

1157
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:24,043
We used to play tag and stuff.

1158
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:30,181
But everything's different now.

1159
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:34,144
Since we moved.

1160
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:10,722
Do you remember how she used to stick
her tongue out when she was coloring?

1161
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,480
I could listen to her stories all day.

1162
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:39,622
I just wanted Riley to be happy.

1163
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,171
And now...

1164
01:09:41,056 --> 01:09:44,886
It was the day the prairie dogs
lost the big playoff game.

1165
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:48,445
Riley missed the winning shot.
She felt awful.

1166
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:50,859
She wanted to quit.

1167
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:10,249
Sadness.

1168
01:10:11,336 --> 01:10:14,756
Mom and dad... the team...

1169
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,469
They came to help because of sadness.

1170
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,354
We have to get back up there.

1171
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:30,362
Joy, we're stuck down here.

1172
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:33,231
We might as well be on another planet.

1173
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,993
Another planet.

1174
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:46,504
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1175
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,668
Who's your friend
who likes to play?

1176
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,551
His rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1177
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:02,184
Who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say?

1178
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:05,351
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1179
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:07,062
his rocket makes
you yell "hooray!"

1180
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,034
Hop in.

1181
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:28,706
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1182
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,919
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1183
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,839
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1184
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:36,883
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1185
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,884
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1186
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:41,546
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing the song to say...

1187
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:49,813
Come on!

1188
01:11:49,893 --> 01:11:52,063
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1189
01:11:52,145 --> 01:11:54,395
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1190
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,401
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1191
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:57,983
who's your friend who likes to play?

1192
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,082
Come on, Joy. One more time.

1193
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:15,457
I got a feeling about this one.

1194
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:17,918
Bing bong, bing bong
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"

1195
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,385
Bing bong, bing bong

1196
01:12:19,423 --> 01:12:21,133
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1197
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:23,546
who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1198
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:26,434
louder! Joy, sing louder!

1199
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,752
To sing this song to say
who's your friend who likes to...

1200
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:32,019
Who's your friend who likes to play?
Bing bong, bing bong

1201
01:12:32,102 --> 01:12:34,022
his rocket makes you yell "hooray!"
Bing bong, bing bong

1202
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,444
who's the best in every way
and wants to sing this song to say

1203
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:37,613
bing bong

1204
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,071
we're gonna make it!

1205
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:49,787
Bing bong! We did it!

1206
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,498
We... bing bong? Bing bong!

1207
01:12:54,625 --> 01:12:56,175
You made it!

1208
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,804
Go! Go save Riley!

1209
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:06,475
Take her to the moon for me. Okay?

1210
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:22,355
I'll try, bing bong.

1211
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:26,912
I promise.

1212
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:41,714
We're home!

1213
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:45,182
Riley? Riley!

1214
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:50,973
I'll call her cell.

1215
01:13:55,018 --> 01:13:56,898
This is terrible. Wait,
is that someone walking towards us?

1216
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:58,189
Yep, let's cross the street.

1217
01:14:03,026 --> 01:14:04,436
It's mom. She's onto us!

1218
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:05,818
- What do we do?
- Where's my bag?

1219
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:07,363
Riley needs to get core memories.

1220
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:08,986
- That's the stuff.
- We keep going.

1221
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,542
Sadness!

1222
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,127
Sadness! Sadness?

1223
01:14:26,216 --> 01:14:28,636
Come on, sadness. Where are you?

1224
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,219
Okay. If I were sadness,
where would I be?

1225
01:14:32,931 --> 01:14:36,561
Everything is awful
and my legs don't work,

1226
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:39,942
and you have to drag me around
while I touch all the...

1227
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:56,957
Oh, no! It's mom again! What do we do?

1228
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:06,381
This is madness!
She shouldn't run away!

1229
01:15:06,423 --> 01:15:07,923
Let's get this idea out of her head.

1230
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,046
Sadness?

1231
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:14,762
- Sadness!
- Joy?

1232
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,557
Wait! Sadness!

1233
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:21,152
Just let me go!
Riley's better off without me!

1234
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,230
Come back!

1235
01:15:27,569 --> 01:15:31,159
Okay, you're saying your husband
was blown away by an elephant.

1236
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,280
Was he with anyone?

1237
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:33,736
Yes! And there she is!

1238
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:35,204
Hey! Come back here!

1239
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,445
Forget it, Jake. It's cloud town.

1240
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:42,751
What? Sadness!

1241
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:46,170
I only make everything worse!

1242
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:48,475
Wait! Sadness!
We got to get you back to...

1243
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,192
- It's stuck!
- Great.

1244
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:02,519
- What do you mean it's stuck?
- Now what?

1245
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,234
Oh, no no no no! What is this?

1246
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:14,823
- How do we stop it?
- I got it!

1247
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:16,577
Make her feel scared!
That'll make her change her mind!

1248
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,700
- Brilliant!
- I know it's brilliant! Do it!

1249
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:20,827
Nothing's working!
Why isn't it working?

1250
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:21,333
- Let me try.
- Great! You broke it!

1251
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:22,538
No, I didn't! don't touch that!

1252
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:23,906
Let me do it! Get out of here!

1253
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:31,925
Guys, we can't make
Riley feel anything.

1254
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,513
What have we done?

1255
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,425
Hey! Hey, look at me!
Did you mean what you said before?

1256
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:40,885
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1257
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,636
Yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it.

1258
01:16:46,523 --> 01:16:48,363
I would die for Riley!
I would die for Riley!

1259
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:50,992
I would die for Riley!

1260
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,290
That's it! I fold!

1261
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:43,456
This is crazy. This is crazy.
No, no, no. Joy. Be positive.

1262
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:49,129
I am positive this is crazy!

1263
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:55,928
- Now!
- For Riley!

1264
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:05,437
- Joy?
- Hang on!

1265
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,773
I wish Joy was here!

1266
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:17,358
It's Joy!

1267
01:18:18,282 --> 01:18:19,492
Stand back!

1268
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:21,531
That worked.

1269
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,338
Well, what would you do,
if you're so smart?

1270
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:26,871
I'd tell you,
but you're too dumb to understand.

1271
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:27,867
What?

1272
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,708
Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1273
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,633
Guess I'll just have to
dumb it down to your level.

1274
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:36,971
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you, but let me try. Duh!

1275
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:47,943
Thank goodness you're back!

1276
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:49,938
- Things are really messed up!
- We found this idea.

1277
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,860
We were just
trying to make happy memories.

1278
01:19:01,909 --> 01:19:03,409
Joy, you got to fix this! Get up there!

1279
01:19:03,493 --> 01:19:05,163
Sadness, it's up to you.

1280
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,495
- Me?
- Sadness?

1281
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:08,751
I can't, Joy.

1282
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:11,422
Yes, you can. Riley needs you.

1283
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:24,507
Okay.

1284
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,790
Wait! Stop! I want to get off!

1285
01:19:59,424 --> 01:20:01,094
All right. Thank you. We will.

1286
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:02,716
Her teacher
hasn't even seen Riley all day.

1287
01:20:02,845 --> 01:20:03,725
- What?
- What was she wearing last?

1288
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,174
- Do you even remember what...
- I can't believe this.

1289
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,805
Riley, there you are! Thank goodness!

1290
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:11,272
We were worried sick!
Where have you been? It's so late!

1291
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:13,403
Honey! What happened?
Are you all right?

1292
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,230
We asked the neighbors,
I called the school,

1293
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:16,395
we talked to your teacher.

1294
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:46,448
I know you don't want me to but...

1295
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:49,164
I miss home.

1296
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,656
I miss Minnesota.

1297
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:59,293
You need me to be happy, but...

1298
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:05,426
I want my old friends,
and my hockey team.

1299
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:09,354
I want to go home.

1300
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:13,221
Please don't be mad.

1301
01:22:16,854 --> 01:22:18,944
- Sweetie.
- We're not mad.

1302
01:22:20,524 --> 01:22:24,034
You know what? I miss Minnesota too.

1303
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:28,317
I miss the woods where we took hikes.

1304
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,663
And the backyard
where you used to play.

1305
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:35,326
Spring lake,
where you learned to skate.

1306
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:38,711
Come here.

1307
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:01,617
Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1308
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,168
Friendship island has expanded.

1309
01:24:03,252 --> 01:24:05,842
Glad they finally opened
that friendly argument section.

1310
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:08,131
I like tragic vampire romance island.

1311
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:10,845
Fashion island? Everyone shut up.

1312
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:13,176
Boy band island?
Hope that's just a phase.

1313
01:24:13,262 --> 01:24:16,972
Say what you want,
I think it's all beautiful.

1314
01:24:17,015 --> 01:24:18,555
All right. Here you go.

1315
01:24:18,642 --> 01:24:21,232
Your new expanded console
is up and runnin'.

1316
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:24,766
Cool! Upgrade!

1317
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:26,865
Hey! Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?

1318
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:29,738
Hey, guys? What's pub-er-Ty?

1319
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,030
I don't know. It's probably not important.

1320
01:24:32,114 --> 01:24:35,784
I have access
to the entire curse word library!

1321
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:37,986
This new console is the...

1322
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:40,577
Sorry. I did it again. My bad.

1323
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:41,784
They're getting to the rink.

1324
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,337
Now when you get out there,
you be aggressive!

1325
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,089
- I know, dad.
- But not too aggressive.

1326
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,921
You know, you guys don't
have to come to every game.

1327
01:24:50,007 --> 01:24:53,007
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one!
Go foghorns!

1328
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:57,561
- Go Riley! Foghorns are the best!
- Okay! I got to go!

1329
01:24:57,639 --> 01:24:58,889
They love us.

1330
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:00,564
Yeah, mom and dad are pretty cool.

1331
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,102
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1332
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,935
She loved the face painting!

1333
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:08,184
Told you it was a great idea!

1334
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:12,526
- Best idea he's had in a while.
- He's a really good guy.

1335
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:18,536
Just in case.

1336
01:25:18,994 --> 01:25:19,994
Oh!

1337
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:22,622
Sorry.

1338
01:25:25,584 --> 01:25:29,714
Girl! Girl! Girl!

1339
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:35,222
Okay. Bye.

1340
01:25:36,178 --> 01:25:38,348
Remember, just hustle.

1341
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:42,024
- Go, Riley!
- You got this!

1342
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:46,191
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1343
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,400
All right. Let's play some hockey!

1344
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:50,982
All right, anger, take it!

1345
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:52,186
Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

1346
01:25:52,236 --> 01:25:53,236
On our left. On our left!

1347
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,070
Let's just try
not to get all smelly this time.

1348
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:57,235
Mom and dad are watching us fail.

1349
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,744
Not for long!

1350
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,118
We've been through a lot lately,
that's for sure.

1351
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:04,164
But we still love our girl.

1352
01:26:04,248 --> 01:26:06,828
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1353
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:08,337
Things couldn't be better.

1354
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:12,708
After all, Riley's twelve now.
What could happen?

1355
01:26:33,277 --> 01:26:36,567
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1356
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:38,623
Anyone? Jordan?

1357
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:42,616
How much more of this?

1358
01:26:42,661 --> 01:26:46,291
Five months, two weeks and four days
until Summer vacation.

1359
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:50,003
Then it's off to the Bahamas
with you know who!

1360
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:53,045
Come fly with me, gatinha.

1361
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,430
Have a nice day.

1362
01:26:59,469 --> 01:27:00,679
What are we mad about?

1363
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:02,642
I don't know.
Whatever Troy's mad about.

1364
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:05,391
- What's Troy mad about?
- I don't know.

1365
01:27:06,143 --> 01:27:07,523
I know. Totally.

1366
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:11,018
We're a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

1367
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,936
Of course not!
We're wearing eye shadow!

1368
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,193
Being cool is so exhausting.

1369
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:20,817
Who's the birthday girl? Hey! Hello?

1370
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:26,366
Six years of drama school for this?

1371
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:27,875
Move it, will you?

1372
01:27:30,584 --> 01:27:32,424
What are you doing? Come on!

1373
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:34,173
You know what? This is okay.
This is fine.

1374
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:36,513
We just need to go to our happy place.

1375
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:37,668
Tripledent gum

1376
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:39,336
no! Not this again!

1377
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:45,638
I smell food.

1378
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:48,018
The man has food.

1379
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,810
Get the food.
